5,"Let me do the following: I’ll separate out the quote for the lenses and send you the quote for the rest. Then follow up with information  about the lenses when I have it.   PoE: I assume you are talking about Power over Ethernet. That actually does not apply to the cameras, as they are not Ethernet cameras.  However, the cameras are powered over the USB3 connection (or the PCIe connection, depending on which version you use). So there is no need to supply them with power separately. If you use multiple cameras with a switch, you  will need a power supply for the  switch, the built-in power from the PCIe subsystem or USB3 subsystem is normally not sufficient to support multiple cameras. For USB3 the maximum power that can be drawn through the cable is 5W, and some cameras get close to that, so that multiple cameras  would exceed that.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517        Thanks Mike.

Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a  correction of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too"
5,"What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I  think we can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches.

5,"5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens.

Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see  which of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec"
5,"Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and  use a lot or power"
5,"In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and  use a lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar  codes(s) with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt,  and when the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple  voltage pulse (up to 24V)"
5,"The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple  voltage pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light  to see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code  is approx. 1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area  of the box. You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm"
5,"You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly  2,400 x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like  4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you  will need multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second"
5,"6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the  12 Mpixel (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras"
5,"Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:     TX2 carrier boards:  https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras  API information:   https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support  Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing  TX2 vs Xavier:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea"

I will get  him involved if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward.

5,"Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the  Jetson (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson.

Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the  box (middle of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give  you a range of focal lengths for the distance you gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you"
6,"These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction  of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too"
6,"What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think  we can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches.

6,"5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches.

Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see  which of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec"
6,"Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and  use a lot or power"
6,"In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and  use a lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s)  with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and  when the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V)"
6,"The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to  see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is  approx. 1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of  the box. You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm"
6,"You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly  2,400 x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like  4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will  need multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second"
6,"6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel  (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras"
6,"Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:     TX2 carrier boards:  https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras  API information:   https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support  Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing  TX2 vs Xavier:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea"

Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country"
6,"Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the  Jetson (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson.  We can also discuss that, if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

7,"Let me do the following: I’ll separate out the quote for the lenses and send you the quote for the rest. Then follow up with information about  the lenses when I have it.   PoE: I assume you are talking about Power over Ethernet. That actually does not apply to the cameras, as they are not Ethernet cameras. However,  the cameras are powered over the USB3 connection (or the PCIe connection, depending on which version you use). So there is no need to supply them with power separately. If you use multiple cameras with a switch, you  will need a power supply for the switch,  the built-in power from the PCIe subsystem or USB3 subsystem is normally not sufficient to support multiple cameras. For USB3 the maximum power that can be drawn through the cable is 5W, and some cameras get close to that, so that multiple cameras would exceed  that.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517        Thanks Mike.

7,"You can make the  ROI smaller to simulate the 5 Mpixel version as otherwise these cameras are identical (same pixel size and operation).

Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the  box (middle of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give  you a range of focal lengths for the distance you gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you"
7,"These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction  of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too"
7,"What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think  we can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width"
7,"5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens.

Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which  of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec"
7,"Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use  a lot or power"
7,"In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use  a lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s)  with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and  when the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V)"
7,"The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to  see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx.  1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box.  You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm"
7,"You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400  x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000  x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will  need multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second"
7,"6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel  (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras"
7,"Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea"

I will get him  involved if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges  on the card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country"
7,"Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson  (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can  also discuss that, if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

That actually does not apply to the cameras, as they are not Ethernet cameras. However,  the cameras are powered over the USB3 connection (or the PCIe connection, depending on which version you use). So there is no need to supply them with power separately. If you use multiple cameras with a switch, you  will need a power supply for the switch,  the built-in power from the PCIe subsystem or USB3 subsystem is normally not sufficient to support multiple cameras. For USB3 the maximum power that can be drawn through the cable is 5W, and some cameras get close to that, so that multiple cameras would exceed  that.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517        Thanks Mike.

Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box  (middle of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give  you a range of focal lengths for the distance you gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you"
8,"These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction  of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too"
8,"What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think  we can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width"
8,"5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face.

Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which  of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec"
8,"Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use  a lot or power"
8,"In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use  a lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s)  with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when  the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V)"
8,"The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to  see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx.  1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box.  You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm"
8,"You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400  x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000  x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will  need multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second"
8,"6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel  (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras"
8,"Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea"

I will get him  involved if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges  on the card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country"
8,"Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson  (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can  also discuss that, if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

Then follow up with information about the  lenses when I have it.   PoE: I assume you are talking about Power over Ethernet. That actually does not apply to the cameras, as they are not Ethernet cameras. However,  the cameras are powered over the USB3 connection (or the PCIe connection, depending on which version you use). So there is no need to supply them with power separately. If you use multiple cameras with a switch, you  will need a power supply for the switch,  the built-in power from the PCIe subsystem or USB3 subsystem is normally not sufficient to support multiple cameras"
9,"For USB3 the maximum power that can be drawn through the cable is 5W, and some cameras get close to that, so that multiple cameras would exceed  that.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517        Thanks Mike.

Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box  (middle of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you  a range of focal lengths for the distance you gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you"
9,"These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction  of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too"
9,"What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we  can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width"
9,"5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens.

Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which  of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec"
9,"Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a  lot or power"
9,"In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a  lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s)  with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when  the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V)"
9,"The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to  see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx.  1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box.  You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm"
9,"You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x  1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000  x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need  multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second"
9,"6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel  (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras"
9,"Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea"

I will get him involved  if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the  card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country"
9,"Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson  (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can  also discuss that, if you want.

Then follow up with information about the  lenses when I have it.   PoE: I assume you are talking about Power over Ethernet. That actually does not apply to the cameras, as they are not Ethernet cameras. However,  the cameras are powered over the USB3 connection (or the PCIe connection, depending on which version you use). So there is no need to supply them with power separately. If you use multiple cameras with a switch, you  will need a power supply for the switch,  the built-in power from the PCIe subsystem or USB3 subsystem is normally not sufficient to support multiple cameras. For USB3 the maximum power that can be drawn through the cable is 5W, and some cameras get close to that, so that multiple cameras would exceed  that.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517        Thanks Mike.

Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you  a range of focal lengths for the distance you gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you"
10,"These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction  of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too"
10,"What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely.

10,"5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches.

Request you to take a look.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which  of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec"
10,"Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a  lot or power"
10,"In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a  lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s)  with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when  the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V)"
10,"The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to  see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx.  1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box.  You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm"
10,"You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x  1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000  x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need  multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second"
10,"6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel  (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras"
10,"Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea"

I will get him involved  if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the  card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country"
10,"Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson  (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can  also discuss that, if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

Then follow up with information about the  lenses when I have it.   PoE: I assume you are talking about Power over Ethernet. That actually does not apply to the cameras, as they are not Ethernet cameras. However,  the cameras are powered over the USB3 connection (or the PCIe connection, depending on which version you use). So there is no need to supply them with power separately. If you use multiple cameras with a switch, you  will need a power supply for the switch,  the built-in power from the PCIe subsystem or USB3 subsystem is normally not sufficient to support multiple cameras"

Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box  (middle of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you  a range of focal lengths for the distance you gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you"
11,"These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction  of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too"
11,"What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we  can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches.

11,"5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face.

Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which  of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec"
11,"Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a  lot or power"
11,"In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a  lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s)  with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when  the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V)"
11,"The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to  see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx.  1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box.  You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm"
11,"You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x  1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000  x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need  multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second"
11,"6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel  (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras"
11,"Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea"

I will get him involved  if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward.

11,"Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson  (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson.

12,"Let me do the following: I’ll separate out the quote for the lenses and send you the quote for the rest. Then follow up with information about the  lenses when I have it.   PoE: I assume you are talking about Power over Ethernet. That actually does not apply to the cameras, as they are not Ethernet cameras. However,  the cameras are powered over the USB3 connection (or the PCIe connection, depending on which version you use). So there is no need to supply them with power separately. If you use multiple cameras with a switch, you  will need a power supply for the switch,  the built-in power from the PCIe subsystem or USB3 subsystem is normally not sufficient to support multiple cameras. For USB3 the maximum power that can be drawn through the cable is 5W, and some cameras get close to that, so that multiple cameras would exceed  that.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517        Thanks Mike.

Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you  a range of focal lengths for the distance you gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you"
12,"These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction  of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too"
12,"What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we  can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches.

12,"5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens.

Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which  of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec"
12,"Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a  lot or power"
12,"In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a  lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s)  with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when  the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V)"
12,"The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to  see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx.  1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box.  You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm"
12,"You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x  1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000  x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need  multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second"
12,"6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel  (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras"
12,"Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea"

I will get him involved  if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the  card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country"
12,"Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson  (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can  also discuss that, if you want.

So there is no need to supply them with power separately. If you use multiple cameras with a switch, you  will need a power supply for the switch,  the built-in power from the PCIe subsystem or USB3 subsystem is normally not sufficient to support multiple cameras"

Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box  (middle of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you  a range of focal lengths for the distance you gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you"
13,"These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction  of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too"
13,"What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we  can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches.

13,"5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face.

Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which  of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec"
13,"Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a  lot or power"
13,"In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a  lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s)  with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when  the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V)"
13,"The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to  see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx.  1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box.  You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm"
13,"You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x  1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000  x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need  multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second"
13,"6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel  (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras"
13,"Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea"

I will get him involved  if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the  card if it comes back undamaged.

13,"Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson  (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson.

14,"Let me do the following: I’ll separate out the quote for the lenses and send you the quote for the rest. Then follow up with information about  the lenses when I have it.   PoE: I assume you are talking about Power over Ethernet. That actually does not apply to the cameras, as they are not Ethernet cameras. However,  the cameras are powered over the USB3 connection (or the PCIe connection, depending on which version you use). So there is no need to supply them with power separately. If you use multiple cameras with a switch, you  will need a power supply for the switch,  the built-in power from the PCIe subsystem or USB3 subsystem is normally not sufficient to support multiple cameras. For USB3 the maximum power that can be drawn through the cable is 5W, and some cameras get close to that, so that multiple cameras would exceed  that.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517        Thanks Mike.

Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths for the distance  you gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you"
14,"These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if the bar code algorithm  can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too"
14,"What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches.

14,"5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face.

Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which  of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec"
14,"Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use  a lot or power"
14,"In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use  a lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s)  with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when  the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V)"
14,"The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to  see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx.  1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box.  You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm"
14,"You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400  x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000  x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will  need multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second"
14,"6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel  (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras"
14,"Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea"

14,"Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson  (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson.

However,  the cameras are powered over the USB3 connection (or the PCIe connection, depending on which version you use). So there is no need to supply them with power separately. If you use multiple cameras with a switch, you  will need a power supply for the switch,  the built-in power from the PCIe subsystem or USB3 subsystem is normally not sufficient to support multiple cameras.

Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box  (middle of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you  a range of focal lengths for the distance you gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you"
15,"These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction  of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too"
15,"What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think  we can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches.

15,"5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face.

Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which  of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec"
15,"Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a  lot or power"
15,"In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a  lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s)  with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when  the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V)"
15,"The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to  see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx.  1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box.  You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm"
15,"You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400  x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000  x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need  multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second"
15,"6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel  (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras"
15,"Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea"

I will get him involved  if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the  card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country"
15,"Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson  (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson.

Then follow up with information  about the lenses when I have it.   PoE: I assume you are talking about Power over Ethernet.

16,"PoE: I assume you are talking about Power over Ethernet. That actually does not apply to the cameras, as they are not Ethernet cameras.  However, the cameras are powered over the USB3 connection (or the PCIe connection, depending on which version you use). So there is no need to supply them with power separately. If you use multiple cameras with a switch, you  will need a power supply for the  switch, the built-in power from the PCIe subsystem or USB3 subsystem is normally not sufficient to support multiple cameras. For USB3 the maximum power that can be drawn through the cable is 5W, and some cameras get close to that, so that multiple cameras  would exceed that.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517        Thanks Mike.

16,"Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed insights. This sounds exciting.   Please find my answers inline in BLUE.     Kevin,   Nice to meet you. Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths for the distance  you gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you"
16,"These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if the bar code algorithm  can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too"
16,"What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width"
16,"5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens.

Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see  which of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec"
16,"Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and  use a lot or power"
16,"In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and  use a lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar  codes(s) with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt,  and when the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple  voltage pulse (up to 24V)"
16,"The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple  voltage pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light  to see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code  is approx. 1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area  of the box. You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm"
16,"You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly  2,400 x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like  4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you  will need multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second"
16,"6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the  12 Mpixel (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras"
16,"Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea"

16,"Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the  Jetson (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson.

Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of the range you  gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths  for the distance you gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you"
17,"These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if  the bar code algorithm can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too"
17,"What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner package  together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches.

17,"5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face.

Thank  you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting  and see which of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec"
17,"Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get  very hot, and use a lot or power"
17,"In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get  very hot, and use a lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate  the bar codes(s) with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.     I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across  the belt, and when the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond  to a simple voltage pulse (up to 24V)"
17,"The cameras can be set up to respond  to a simple voltage pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on  the strobe light to see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The  bar code is approx. 1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3  feet area of the box. You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm"
17,"You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution  of roughly 2,400 x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something  like 4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that  means you will need multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second"
17,"6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that  even the 12 Mpixel (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras"
17,"Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea"

I will get him involved if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there  will be no charges on the card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country"
17,"Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better  to put the Jetson (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for  the Jetson.

18,"PoE: I assume you are talking about Power over Ethernet. That actually does not apply to the cameras, as they are not Ethernet  cameras. However, the cameras are powered over the USB3 connection (or the PCIe connection, depending on which version you use). So there is no need to supply them with power separately. If you use multiple cameras with a switch, you  will need a power supply  for the switch, the built-in power from the PCIe subsystem or USB3 subsystem is normally not sufficient to support multiple cameras. For USB3 the maximum power that can be drawn through the cable is 5W, and some cameras get close to that, so that multiple  cameras would exceed that.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517        Thanks Mike.

Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of the range you  gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths  for the distance you gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you"
18,"These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if the  bar code algorithm can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too"
18,"What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner package  together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width"
18,"5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens. Please let me know if you require any additional details.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Thank you, Mike.

Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting  and see which of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec"
18,"Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very  hot, and use a lot or power"
18,"In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very  hot, and use a lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate  the bar codes(s) with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.     I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the  belt, and when the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a  simple voltage pulse (up to 24V)"
18,"The cameras can be set up to respond to a  simple voltage pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe  light to see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar  code is approx. 1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet  area of the box. You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm"
18,"You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of  roughly 2,400 x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something  like 4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means  you will need multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second"
18,"6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even  the 12 Mpixel (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras"
18,"Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea"

I will get him involved if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there  will be no charges on the card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country"
18,"Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to  put the Jetson (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the  Jetson. We can also discuss that, if you want.

Makes sense.     Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths for the distance you gave me: at 30” working  distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard.  Thank you"
19,"These lenses are fairly standard.  Thank you.     The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can deal with it. A  correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement.  Our team should be able to take care of this.     I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.     I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:      What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too"
19,"What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?     So, I think this is progressing quite nicely.

19,"5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face.

Thank you.     Hello Gentlemen,     Thank you for talking to me yesterday.      I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which of our cameras could get you there.     Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec"
19,"Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.      In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot or power"
19,"In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot  light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.   The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s) with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.      I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that  triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse (up to 24V)"
19,"The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite  simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to see what is needed there.     Geometry:     You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx. 1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture  that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box. You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet  area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).      4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm"
19,"You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet  area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).      4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the  side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000 x 2000.     This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.      Frame rate.      The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes  are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second"
19,"6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation  can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.      So, which camera should you use?     I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras"
19,"Using a  Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do have  the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode.

In that case it might be better to put the Jetson (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a  dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can also discuss that, if you want. We can design such an interface  board to your specifications.     I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.     Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517       Sorry.

20,"Let me do the following: I’ll separate out the quote for the lenses and send you the quote for the rest. Then follow up with information about the lenses when  I have it.   PoE: I assume you are talking about Power over Ethernet. That actually does not apply to the cameras, as they are not Ethernet cameras. However, the cameras  are powered over the USB3 connection (or the PCIe connection, depending on which version you use). So there is no need to supply them with power separately. If you use multiple cameras with a switch, you  will need a power supply for the switch, the built-in  power from the PCIe subsystem or USB3 subsystem is normally not sufficient to support multiple cameras. For USB3 the maximum power that can be drawn through the cable is 5W, and some cameras get close to that, so that multiple cameras would exceed that.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517        Thanks Mike.

Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of  the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of  focal lengths for the distance you gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you"
20,"These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image,  or if the bar code algorithm can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too"
20,"What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a  loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width"
20,"5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens. Please let me know if you require any additional details.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Thank you, Mike.

Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which of our cameras  could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec"
20,"Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot or power"
20,"In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot or power.  But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s) with a short  enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when the box interrupts  the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse (up to 24V)"
20,"The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse (up to 24V).  So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to see what is needed  there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx. 1.5 inches  wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box. You would  need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm"
20,"You would  need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x 1,800. The  same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need multiple  images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second"
20,"6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel (4000 x 3000)  in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras"
20,"Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea"

I will get him involved if you  want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the card  if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country"
20,"Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson (if you want  to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can also discuss  that, if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of the  range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of  focal lengths for the distance you gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you"
21,"These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image,  or if the bar code algorithm can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too"
21,"What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner  package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width"
21,"5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens.

Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which of our cameras  could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec"
21,"Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot or power"
21,"In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot or power.  But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s) with a short  enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when the box interrupts  the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse (up to 24V)"
21,"The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse (up to 24V).  So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to see what is needed  there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx. 1.5 inches  wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box. You would  need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm"
21,"You would  need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x 1,800. The  same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need multiple images  per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second"
21,"6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel (4000 x 3000) in  the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras"
21,"Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea"

I will get him involved if you  want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the card  if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country"
21,"Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson (if you want  to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson.

22,"The lens is designed for a 2/3” sensor, and the 12 Mpixel sensor is 1.1”, so coverage  at the edges will not be good. But, it would be adequate if you made a ROI for the center 5 Mpixels.

Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle  of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you  a range of focal lengths for the distance you gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you"
22,"These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction  of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too"
22,"What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we  can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width"
22,"5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens.

You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec"
22,"Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot  or power"
22,"In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot  or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s) with  a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when the  box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse  (up to 24V)"
22,"The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse  (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to see what  is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx.  1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box.  You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm"
22,"You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x 1,800.  The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need  multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second"
22,"6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel  (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras"
22,"Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea"

I will get him involved  if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the  card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country"
22,"Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson (if  you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can also  discuss that, if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle  of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you  a range of focal lengths for the distance you gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you"
23,"These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction  of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too"
23,"What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we  can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width"
23,"5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens.

Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which of  our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec"
23,"Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot  or power"
23,"In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot  or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s) with  a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when the  box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse  (up to 24V)"
23,"The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse  (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to see what  is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx.  1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box.  You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm"
23,"You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x 1,800.  The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need  multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second"
23,"6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel  (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras"
23,"Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea"

I will get him involved  if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the  card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country"
23,"Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson (if  you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can also  discuss that, if you want.

Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of the  range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal  lengths for the distance you gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you"
24,"These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image,  or if the bar code algorithm can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too"
24,"What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner  package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width"
24,"5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face.

Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which of our cameras  could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec"
24,"Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot or power"
24,"In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot or power.  But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s) with a short  enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when the box interrupts  the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse (up to 24V)"
24,"The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse (up to 24V).  So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to see what is needed  there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx. 1.5 inches  wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box. You would  need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm"
24,"You would  need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x 1,800. The same  calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need multiple images  per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second"
24,"6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel (4000 x 3000) in  the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras"
24,"Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea"

24,"Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson (if you want  to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson.

25,"The lens is designed for a 2/3” sensor, and the 12 Mpixel sensor is 1.1”, so coverage  at the edges will not be good. But, it would be adequate if you made a ROI for the center 5 Mpixels.

Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle  of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you  a range of focal lengths for the distance you gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you"
25,"These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction  of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too"
25,"What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we  can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width"
25,"5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens.

Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which of  our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec"
25,"Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot  or power"
25,"In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot  or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s) with  a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when the  box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse  (up to 24V)"
25,"The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse  (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to see what  is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx.  1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box.  You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm"
25,"You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x  1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000  x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need  multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second"
25,"6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel  (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras"
25,"Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea"

I will get him involved  if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the  card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country"
25,"Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson (if  you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can also  discuss that, if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle  of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a  range of focal lengths for the distance you gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you"
26,"These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction  of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too"
26,"What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can  put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width"
26,"5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches.

But I will check and let you know.   The items you would need for your test are:   MC023MG-SY-UB (this is a monochrome camera) We can add a zoom lens, but I need to know what the desired field of view is (i.e., the area that you can guarantee contains the bar code).  The focal length of the lens will depend on that size. A mounting bracket and a USB3 cable is not an issue. We should also have a trigger cable that you can use.   For the strobe light I have to wait until I hear back from the company that we end up getting them from.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Good morning and hope you had a great weekend"

I am also marking the rest of the team on this email so nobody misses anything.   Hi Ash, Vivek – Mike has provided some rough calculations based on the info we provided. Request you to take a look.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which of our  cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec"
26,"Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot  or power"
26,"In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot  or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s) with  a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when the  box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse  (up to 24V)"
26,"The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse  (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to see what  is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx. 1.5  inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box. You  would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm"
26,"You  would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x 1,800.  The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need multiple  images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second"
26,"6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel (4000 x 3000)  in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras"
26,"Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea"

I will get him involved  if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the  card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country"
26,"Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson (if  you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can also  discuss that, if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

27,"You can make the ROI smaller to simulate the 5 Mpixel  version as otherwise these cameras are identical (same pixel size and operation). I have a 16mm lens that will cover the area the 5 Mpixel version would need, but it does not completely cover all 12 Mpixels, so you will see some dark edges when imaging with  the whole focal plane. If you want a color camera, I do have the 5 Mpixel version. Let me know what other accessories you’d like with the loan (a 3m USB cable is typical).

27,"Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed insights. This sounds exciting.   Please find my answers inline in BLUE.     Kevin,   Nice to meet you. Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of the range you gave  me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths for  the distance you gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you"
27,"These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if the bar  code algorithm can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too"
27,"What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner package together  for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width"
27,"5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens. Please let me know if you require any additional details.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Thank you, Mike.

But I will check and let you know.   The items you would need for your test are:   MC023MG-SY-UB (this is a monochrome camera) We can add a zoom lens, but I need to know what the desired field of view is (i.e., the area that you can guarantee contains  the bar code). The focal length of the lens will depend on that size. A mounting bracket and a USB3 cable is not an issue.

Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and  see which of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec"
27,"Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot,  and use a lot or power"
27,"In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot,  and use a lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the  bar codes(s) with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt,  and when the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple  voltage pulse (up to 24V)"
27,"The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple  voltage pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light  to see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code  is approx. 1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area  of the box. You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm"
27,"You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly  2,400 x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like  4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means  you will need multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second"
27,"6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even  the 12 Mpixel (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras"
27,"Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea"

I will  get him involved if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be  no charges on the card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country"
27,"Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put  the Jetson (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson.  We can also discuss that, if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

28,"The lens is designed for a 2/3” sensor, and the 12 Mpixel sensor is 1.1”, so coverage at the edges will not be good. But, it would  be adequate if you made a ROI for the center 5 Mpixels.

Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths for the distance you  gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you"
28,"These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if the bar code algorithm  can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too"
28,"What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width"
28,"5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens. Please let me know if you require any additional details.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Thank you, Mike.

28,"I have to check what we can do about the strobe light.  We don’t typically sell those, so we don’t have them as loan items either. But I will check and let you know.   The items you would need for your test are:   MC023MG-SY-UB (this is a monochrome camera) We can add a zoom lens, but I need to know what the desired field of view is (i.e., the area that you can guarantee contains the  bar code). The focal length of the lens will depend on that size. A mounting bracket and a USB3 cable is not an issue. We should also have a trigger cable that you can use.   For the strobe light I have to wait until I hear back from the company that we end up getting them from.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Good morning and hope you had a great weekend"

Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which  of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec"
28,"Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use  a lot or power"
28,"In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use  a lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s)  with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when  the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V)"
28,"The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to  see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx.  1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box.  You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm"
28,"You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400  x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000  x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will  need multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second"
28,"6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel  (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras"
28,"Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea"

I will get him  involved if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges  on the card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country"
28,"Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson  (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can  also discuss that, if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths for the distance you  gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you"
29,"These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if the bar code algorithm  can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too"
29,"What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width"
29,"5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens.

Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which  of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec"
29,"Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use  a lot or power"
29,"In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use  a lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s)  with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when  the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V)"
29,"The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to  see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx.  1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box.  You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm"
29,"You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400  x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000  x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will  need multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second"
29,"6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel  (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras"
29,"Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea"

I will get him  involved if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges  on the card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country"
29,"Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson  (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can  also discuss that, if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths for the distance you  gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you"
30,"These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can  deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too"
30,"What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width"
30,"5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens.

Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which  of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec"
30,"Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use  a lot or power"
30,"In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use  a lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s)  with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when  the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V)"
30,"The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to  see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx.  1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box.  You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm"
30,"You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400  x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000  x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need  multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second"
30,"6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel  (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras"
30,"Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea"

I will get him  involved if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges  on the card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country"
30,"Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson  (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can  also discuss that, if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths for the distance you gave  me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you"
31,"These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can  deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too"
31,"What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely.

31,"5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face.

I am also marking the rest of the team on this email so nobody misses anything.   Hi Ash, Vivek – Mike has provided some rough calculations based on the info we provided. Request you to take a look.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which of  our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec"
31,"Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot  or power"
31,"In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot  or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s) with  a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when the  box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse  (up to 24V)"
31,"The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse  (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to see what  is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx.  1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box.  You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm"
31,"You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x 1,800.  The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need  multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second"
31,"6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel  (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras"
31,"Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea"

I will get him involved  if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the  card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country"
31,"Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson (if  you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can also  discuss that, if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

32,"These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can  deal with it.

Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:    What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging.What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too"
32,"What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:  The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches.

32,"5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width.The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches.Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches.Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches.

Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which  of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec"
32,"Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a  lot or power"
32,"In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a  lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s)  with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when  the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V)"
32,"The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to  see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx.  1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box.  You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm"
32,"You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400  x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000  x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need  multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second"
32,"6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel  (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras"
32,"Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea"

I will get him involved  if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the  card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country"
32,"Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson  (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can  also discuss that, if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths for the distance you gave  me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you"
33,"These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can  deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too"
33,"What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches.

33,"5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face.

Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which of  our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec"
33,"Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot  or power"
33,"In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot  or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s) with  a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when the  box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse  (up to 24V)"
33,"The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse  (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to see what  is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx. 1.5  inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box. You  would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm"
33,"You  would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x 1,800.  The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need multiple  images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second"
33,"6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel (4000 x 3000)  in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras"
33,"Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode.

33,"Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson (if  you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson.

Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths for the distance you  gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you"
34,"These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if the bar code algorithm  can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too"
34,"What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches.

34,"5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face.

Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which  of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec"
34,"Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use  a lot or power"
34,"In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use  a lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s)  with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when  the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V)"
34,"The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to  see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx.  1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box.  You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm"
34,"You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400  x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000  x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will  need multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second"
34,"6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel  (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras"
34,"Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea"

34,"Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson  (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson.

Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths for the distance you  gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you"
35,"These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can  deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too"
35,"What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width"
35,"5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face.

Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which  of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec"
35,"Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a  lot or power"
35,"In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a  lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s)  with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when  the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V)"
35,"The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to  see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx.  1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box.  You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm"
35,"You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x  1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000  x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need  multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second"
35,"6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel  (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras"
35,"Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea"

I will get him involved  if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the  card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country"
35,"Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson  (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can  also discuss that, if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

These lights are not a product of ours so I have a number of outstanding questions about their function, but I got them to work with some basic triggering, however not in conjunction with a  camera. There is very little documentation about how to use them, but it seems straight forward enough. You must supply the lights with 24V (power supply included) and then with a 5V trigger to get them to pulse. I’ll include the specification sheet for them  which will give you the pinout at least.

Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths for the distance you  gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you"
36,"These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can  deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too"
36,"What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches.

36,"5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face.

Request you to take a look.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which  of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec"
36,"Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a  lot or power"
36,"In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a  lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s)  with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when  the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V)"
36,"The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to  see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx.  1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box.  You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm"
36,"You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x  1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000  x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need  multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second"
36,"6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel  (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras"
36,"Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea"

I will get him involved  if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the  card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country"
36,"Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson  (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can  also discuss that, if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

37,"You can make the ROI smaller to simulate the 5 Mpixel version as  otherwise these cameras are identical (same pixel size and operation). I have a 16mm lens that will cover the area the 5 Mpixel version would need, but it does not completely cover all 12 Mpixels, so you will see some dark edges when imaging with the whole  focal plane. If you want a color camera, I do have the 5 Mpixel version. Let me know what other accessories you’d like with the loan (a 3m USB cable is typical).

Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths for the distance you  gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you"
37,"These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if the bar code algorithm  can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too"
37,"What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width"
37,"5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens.

Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which  of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec"
37,"Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use  a lot or power"
37,"In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use  a lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s)  with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when  the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V)"
37,"The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to  see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx.  1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box.  You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm"
37,"You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400  x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000  x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will  need multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second"
37,"6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel  (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras"
37,"Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea"

I will get him  involved if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward.

Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country"
37,"Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson  (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson.

Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths for the distance you  gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you"
38,"These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can  deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too"
38,"What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width"
38,"5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens.

Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which  of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec"
38,"Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use  a lot or power"
38,"In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use  a lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s)  with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when  the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V)"
38,"The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to  see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx.  1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box.  You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm"
38,"You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400  x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000  x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need  multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second"
38,"6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel  (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras"
38,"Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea"

I will get him  involved if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges  on the card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country"
38,"Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson  (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson.

Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths for the distance you  gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you"
39,"These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can  deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too"
39,"What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches.

39,"5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face.

Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which  of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec"
39,"Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use  a lot or power"
39,"In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use  a lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s)  with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when  the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V)"
39,"The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to  see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx.  1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box.  You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm"
39,"You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400  x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000  x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need  multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second"
39,"6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel  (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras"
39,"Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea"

39,"Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson  (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson.

Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths for the distance you gave  me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you"
40,"These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can  deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:    What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging.What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too"
40,"What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:  The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches.

40,"5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width.The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches.Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches.Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches.

Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which  of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec"
40,"Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a  lot or power"
40,"In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a  lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s)  with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when  the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V)"
40,"The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to  see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx.  1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box.  You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm"
40,"You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400  x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000  x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need  multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second"
40,"6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel  (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras"
40,"Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea"

We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the  card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country"
40,"Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson  (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can  also discuss that, if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths for the distance you gave  me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you"
41,"These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can  deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:    What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging.What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too"
41,"What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely.

Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which  of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec"
41,"Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a  lot or power"
41,"In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a  lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s)  with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when  the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V)"
41,"The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to  see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx.  1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box.  You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm"
41,"You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400  x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000  x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need  multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second"
41,"6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel  (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras"
41,"Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea"

I will get him involved  if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the  card if it comes back undamaged.

41,"Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson  (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson.

Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths for the distance you gave  me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you"
42,"These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can  deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:    What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging.What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too"
42,"What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet?

Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which of  our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec"
42,"Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot  or power"
42,"In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot  or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s) with  a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when the  box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse  (up to 24V)"
42,"The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse  (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to see what  is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx.  1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box.  You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm"
42,"You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x  1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000  x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need  multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second"
42,"6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel  (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras"
42,"Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea"

I will get him involved  if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the  card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country"
42,"Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson (if  you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can also  discuss that, if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

Makes sense.     Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths for the distance you gave me: at 30” working  distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm.

43,"These lenses are fairly standard.  Thank you.     The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can deal with it.

Kevin will know.     I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:      What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too"
43,"What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too.

The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.      In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot or power"
43,"In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot  light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.   The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s) with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.      I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that  triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse (up to 24V)"
43,"The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite  simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to see what is needed there.     Geometry:     You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx. 1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture  that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box. You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet  area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).      4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm"
43,"You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet  area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).      4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the  side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000 x 2000.     This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.      Frame rate.      The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes  are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second"
43,"6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation  can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.      So, which camera should you use?     I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras"
43,"Using a  Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do have  the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode.

43,"Things get more  complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.     Further thought:     What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a  dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson.

Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths  for the distance you gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you"
44,"These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or  if the bar code algorithm can deal with it.

Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:    What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging.What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too"

44,"In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot or power. But It  might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s) with a short enough  pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when the box interrupts the  beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse (up to 24V)"
44,"The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse (up to 24V). So,  the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx. 1.5 inches wide. Obviously,  you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box. You would need a camera that  can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm"
44,"You would need a camera that  can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x 1,800. The same calculation  applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need multiple images per  second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second"
44,"6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel (4000 x 3000) in the  (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras"
44,"Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea"

I will get him involved if you want to  try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the card if it comes  back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country"
44,"Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson (if you want to use  one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson.

Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths  for the distance you gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you"
45,"These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if  the bar code algorithm can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:    What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging.What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too"
45,"What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too.

You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec"
45,"Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time.

To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x 1,800. The same calculation  applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need multiple images per  second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second"
45,"6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel (4000 x 3000) in the  (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras"
45,"Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images.

45,"Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson (if you want to use one)  plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson.

Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths  for the distance you gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you"
46,"These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if  the bar code algorithm can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too"
46,"What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely.

46,"5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches.

Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which of our cameras could get  you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec"
46,"Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot or power"
46,"In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot or power. But It might  be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s) with a short enough pulse  of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when the box interrupts the beam,  a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse (up to 24V)"
46,"The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger  could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx. 1.5 inches wide. Obviously,  you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box. You would need a camera that  can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm"
46,"You would need a camera that  can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x 1,800. The same calculation  applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need multiple images per second  (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second"
46,"6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively  slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras"

Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of the range you  gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths  for the distance you gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you"
47,"These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if  the bar code algorithm can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too"
47,"What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner package  together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width"
47,"5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face.

Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which of our cameras could get  you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec"
47,"Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot or power"
47,"In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot or power. But It might  be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s) with a short enough pulse  of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when the box interrupts the beam,  a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse (up to 24V)"
47,"The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger  could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx. 1.5 inches wide. Obviously,  you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box. You would need a camera that  can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm"
47,"You would need a camera that  can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x 1,800. The same calculation  applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need multiple images per second  (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second"
47,"6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively  slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras"

Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of the range you  gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths  for the distance you gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you"
48,"These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if  the bar code algorithm can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too"
48,"What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner package  together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width"
48,"5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens.

Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which of our cameras could get  you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec"
48,"Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot or power"
48,"In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot or power. But It might  be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s) with a short enough pulse  of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when the box interrupts the beam,  a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse (up to 24V)"
48,"The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger  could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx. 1.5 inches wide. Obviously,  you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box. You would need a camera that  can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm"
48,"You would need a camera that  can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x 1,800. The same calculation  applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need multiple images per second  (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second"
48,"6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively  slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras"
48,"Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea"

I will get him involved if you want to try  the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the card if it comes  back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country"
48,"Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson (if you want to use one)  plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can also discuss that, if you  want.

Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of the range you  gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths  for the distance you gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you"
49,"These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if  the bar code algorithm can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too"
49,"What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner package  together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width"
49,"5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens.

Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which of our cameras could get  you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec"
49,"Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot or power"
49,"In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot or power. But It might  be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s) with a short enough pulse  of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when the box interrupts the beam,  a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse (up to 24V)"
49,"The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger  could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx. 1.5 inches wide. Obviously,  you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box. You would need a camera that  can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm"
49,"You would need a camera that  can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x 1,800. The same calculation  applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need multiple images per second  (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second"
49,"6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively  slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras"
49,"Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea"

I will get him involved if you want to try  the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the card if it comes  back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country"
49,"Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson (if you want to use one)  plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson.

Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths for the distance you gave me:  at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you"
50,"These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can deal  with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:    What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging.What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too"
50,"What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:  The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches.

50,"5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width.The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches.Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches.Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face.The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens.

Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which  of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec"
50,"Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use  a lot or power"
50,"In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use  a lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s)  with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and  when the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V)"
50,"The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to  see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx.  1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box.  You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm"
50,"You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400  x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000  x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will  need multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second"
50,"6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel  (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras"
50,"Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea"

I will get him  involved if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges  on the card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country"
50,"Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson  (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can  also discuss that, if you want.

Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths for the distance you gave me:  at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm.

51,"These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can deal  with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes?

Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which of our  cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec"
51,"Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot or  power"
51,"In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot or  power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s) with a  short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when the box  interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse (up  to 24V)"
51,"The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse (up  to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to see what is  needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx. 1.5 inches  wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box. You would  need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm"
51,"You would  need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x 1,800.  The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need multiple  images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second"
51,"6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel (4000 x 3000)  in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras"
51,"Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode.

51,"Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson (if you  want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson.

To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time.

52,"In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot or  power.

The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s) with a  short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition.

The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse (up  to 24V)"
52,"The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse (up  to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to see what is  needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx. 1.5 inches  wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box. You would  need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm"
52,"You would  need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x 1,800.  The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need multiple  images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second"
52,"6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel (4000 x 3000)  in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras"
52,"Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea"

I will get him involved  if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the  card if it comes back undamaged.

52,"Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson (if you  want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson.

Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths for the distance you gave me:  at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you"
53,"These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can deal  with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:    What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging.What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too"
53,"What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely.

53,"The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse  (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to see what  is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx. 1.5  inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box. You  would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm"
53,"You  would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x 1,800.  The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need multiple  images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second"
53,"6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel (4000 x 3000)  in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras"

Makes sense.     Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths for the distance you gave me: at 30” working  distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard.  Thank you"
54,"These lenses are fairly standard.  Thank you.     The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can deal with it. A  correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement.  Our team should be able to take care of this.     I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.     I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:      What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too"
54,"What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?     So, I think this is progressing quite nicely.

You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec"
54,"Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.      In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot or power"
54,"In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light  to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.   The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s) with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.      I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers  the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image.

Makes sense.     Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths for the distance you gave me: at 30” working  distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard.  Thank you"
55,"These lenses are fairly standard.  Thank you.     The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can deal with it. A  correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement.  Our team should be able to take care of this.     I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.     I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:      What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too"
55,"What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?     So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner package together for you.     Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517       Mike,     We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches.

55,"5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face.

Thank you.     Hello Gentlemen,     Thank you for talking to me yesterday.      I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which of our cameras could get you there.     Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec"
55,"Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.      In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot or power"
55,"In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot  light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.   The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s) with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.      I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that  triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse (up to 24V)"
55,"The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite  simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to see what is needed there.     Geometry:     You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx. 1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture  that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box. You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet  area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).      4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm"
55,"You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet  area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).      4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the  side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000 x 2000.     This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.      Frame rate.      The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes  are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second"
55,"6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation  can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.      So, which camera should you use?     I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras"
55,"Using a  Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do have  the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:     TX2 carrier boards:  https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras  API information:   https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support  Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing  TX2 vs Xavier:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier  Nano benchmarks:  https://www.ximea"

I will get him involved if you want to try the camera to see if it works.  The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the card if it comes back undamaged.

55,"Things get more  complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.     Further thought:     What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a  dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson.

56,"Hi Aman, do you want a monochrome camera or color? If mono, I have only a MC124MG-SY-UB camera available at the moment. You can make the ROI smaller to simulate the 5 Mpixel version as otherwise these cameras  are identical (same pixel size and operation). I have a 16mm lens that will cover the area the 5 Mpixel version would need, but it does not completely cover all 12 Mpixels, so you will see some dark edges when imaging with the whole focal plane. If you want  a color camera, I do have the 5 Mpixel version. Let me know what other accessories you’d like with the loan (a 3m USB cable is typical). I will need your complete contact information in including ship to address and phone number as well I’ll need a credit  card to back the loan.

Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec"
56,"Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot or power"
56,"In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot or power. But It might be worth a try to  use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s) with a short enough pulse of light to freeze  the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated  that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse (up to 24V)"
56,"The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated  quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx. 1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take  a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box. You would need a camera that can image the  4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).     4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm"
56,"You would need a camera that can image the  4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).     4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera  on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need multiple images per second (for example, if  the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second"
56,"6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3  implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras"
56,"Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea"

I will get him involved if you want to try the camera to see if  it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the card if it comes back undamaged. Things  get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country"
56,"Things  get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson (if you want to use one) plus the camera and  lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can also discuss that, if you want. We can design  such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec"
57,"Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot or power"
57,"In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot or power. But It might be worth a try to  use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s) with a short enough pulse of light to freeze  the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated  that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse (up to 24V)"
57,"The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse (up to 24V).

To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the  camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec.

Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson (if you want to use one) plus the camera and  lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson.

These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if the bar code algorithm  can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you.

The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging.What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production.

59,"Mike,   Thank you for the detailed insights. This sounds exciting.   Please find my answers inline in BLUE.     Kevin,   Nice to meet you. Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths for the distance you  gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you"
59,"These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if the bar code algorithm  can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:    What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging.What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too"
59,"What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:  The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches.

Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec"
59,"Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot or power"
59,"In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use  a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s) with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the  motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated  that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse (up to 24V)"
59,"The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated  quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx. 1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take  a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box. You would need a camera that can image the  4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).     4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm"
59,"You would need a camera that can image the  4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).     4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera  on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need multiple images per second (for example, if  the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second"
59,"6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3  implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras"
59,"Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode.

Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday"
60,"Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time"
60,"That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot or power. But It might be worth a try to  use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s) with a short enough pulse of light to freeze  the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition"
60,"I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated  that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated  quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx. 1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take  a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes"
60,"The bar code is approx. 1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take  a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box. You would need a camera that can image the  4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).     4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the  camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec"
60,"This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need multiple images per second (for example,  if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3  implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras"
60,"In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.   Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode.

Things  get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson (if you want to use one) plus the camera and  lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson.

Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday"
64,"Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time"
64,"That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use  a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s) with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the  motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition"
64,"I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated  that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated  quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx. 1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take  a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes"
64,"The bar code is approx. 1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take  a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box. You would need a camera that can image the  4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).     4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera  on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec"
64,"This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need multiple images per second (for example, if the  boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation  can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras"
64,"In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.   Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea"

I will get him involved if you want to try the camera to see if  it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward.

64,"The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the card if it comes back undamaged. Things  get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens  into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can also discuss that, if you want. We can design such  an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you"

Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec"
66,"Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot or power"
66,"In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use  a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s) with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the  motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated  that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse (up to 24V)"
66,"The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated  quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx. 1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take  a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box. You would need a camera that can image the  4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).     4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm"
66,"You would need a camera that can image the  4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).     4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera  on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need multiple images per second (for example, if the  boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second"
66,"6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation  can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras"
66,"Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images.

Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces"
68,"The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot or power. But It might be worth  a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur"
68,"But It might be worth  a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s) with a short enough pulse of light  to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when the box interrupts the beam, a signal  is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could  be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse"
68,"So, the trigger could  be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx. 1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you  need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box. You would need a camera that  can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x 1,800. The same calculation applies  to the camera on the side of the box"
68,"To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x 1,800. The same calculation applies  to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec.

70,"Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec)"
70,"To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot or power. But It might be  worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s) with a short enough pulse of light  to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition"
70,"I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when the box interrupts the beam, a  signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger  could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx. 1.5 inches wide. Obviously,  you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes"
70,"The bar code is approx. 1.5 inches wide. Obviously,  you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box. You would need a camera that  can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x 1,800. The same calculation applies  to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec"
70,"This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need multiple images per second (for  example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively  slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras"
70,"In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.   Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode.
