"Hello Kevin & Mike,   My apologies, please ignore my previous email regarding the Lens order.   We do not require it anymore.              Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517       Hello Kevin & Mike,     I am just following up on my earlier email. We need to purchase a 16mm Lens on an urgent basis.   Would you please initiate the process and share the details?            Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517       Hello Kevin,    We need to purchase one 16mm Lens on an urgent basis. Would you please initiate the process as this high priority?    Look forward to your response.              Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517       Hello Kevin,   I hope you are doing well.  We would like to order one 16mm Lens on an urgent basis as a loaner. Would you please initiate the process and share the details of the shipment with us?  Look forward to your response.             Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517       Hello Kevin,   Thanks for the note and the update. I have asked the team on the way forward with the 12mm lens and the camera quotes (QUO-0011162)  sent earlier.    I will get back to you shortly. Meanwhile, I have asked Nicole if QUO-0011162 expiry can be put on hold for 24 hours while the team gets back to me.       Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hi Hemdeep, quote inbound and loans extended to July 8. For clarity, we have no cameras on order for you right now…       Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Kevin,   Slight change in the Lens quote due to some changes in requirement.    We will require  one Computar Lens – V1228-MPY2 – 1.1” 12mm F2.8 12 Megapixel (C Mount) Machine Vision Lens ASAP. Would be great if you could send us a revised Lens quote for only this based on the description.    Additionally, any light you can shed on the loaner extension would be helpful as well.       Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517  Hello Kevin,   Thanks for the quotes. Meanwhile, based on Ash’s query, will it be possible to extend the current loaners for another 45 days till we procure addl. cameras?      Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517  Thanks Kevin. We’re in the final leg for the first use case. If you can extend the loan by a month while we work on procuring additional cameras, that would be a great help.    To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader   --  Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hi Ashutosh, your loans have expired, but I can renew again if you need? Just let me know…   Kevin      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517        Mike,       Correction. We’re using color camera with the 16mm lens currently, and need to secure 12mm lens as a loaner from your partner.         To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --     Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517          Thanks Mike. To summarize, here’s our current configuration:     Monochrome camera is being used with 35mm lens. We’d like to source both camera and lens (2 units each) from you.Color camera is being used with 12mm lens currently, but we’d like to also try the 16mm lens and observe which one’s better. We’d like to source  the color camera from you and can work with the lens partner for a 16mm lens loaner for our testing (they loaned us the 12mm lens while we’re establishing a reseller relationship).  We’d need cables and mounts for all three cameras.         To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --     Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Hi Ash,   I should be able to give you a few prices for lenses in a couple of days.   Let me do the following: I’ll separate out the quote for the lenses and send you the quote for the rest. Then follow up with information  about the lenses when I have it.   PoE: I assume you are talking about Power over Ethernet. That actually does not apply to the cameras, as they are not Ethernet cameras.  However, the cameras are powered over the USB3 connection (or the PCIe connection, depending on which version you use). So there is no need to supply them with power separately. If you use multiple cameras with a switch, you  will need a power supply for the  switch, the built-in power from the PCIe subsystem or USB3 subsystem is normally not sufficient to support multiple cameras. For USB3 the maximum power that can be drawn through the cable is 5W, and some cameras get close to that, so that multiple cameras  would exceed that.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517        Thanks Mike. That’d work.        For the color camera, we sourced lens from the partner you’d introduced. If you can provide us quote for the lens we used with the monochrome camera for the conveyer  belt use case, we can procure color camera lens directly from your partner as we did in the past for other use cases.       Additionally, is there a PoE version of these cameras for production deployment?         To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Of course. I am trying to get some prices for lenses. You have lenses that are wither not designed for the 12 MPix  cameras, or that are very expensive. I am currently  talking to our vendors to see what we can do about that. If you prefer, I can quote the lenses that we sent you. Should I do that?      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Hello Mike,   Just following up on this. Do let me know how we should go about closing. Would be great if you could set us up with the correct quote and PO.       Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517  Hello Mike,   Please find below the new requirements summarised for ease:     Monochrome Camera (https://www.ximea.com/en/products/usb-31-gen-1-with-sony-cmos-xic/mc124mg-sy)     We will require 2 pieces       Colour Camera (https://www.ximea.com/en/products/usb-31-gen-1-with-sony-cmos-xic/mc124cg-sy)     We will require 1 piece       12mm, 16mm, and 35mm lenses Three USB 3.0 cables Three Mounting Brackets   Do let us know how to proceed with this order.       Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517       Mike,       We’ll send over the specs of what we’re using.   And a small clarification. We need two monochrome cameras with lenses, and a color camera. All with mounting brackets and USB cables.           To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Hi Ash, Hemdeep,   I think the easiest would be to send you a formal quote, and then you can send us a PO with reference to the quote. I can set that up, but I want to make sure I quote  the right products.   You mention 2 color and 1 monochrome camera. Based on the loan documents, that could be either a 5 MPix camera (MC050xG-SY-UB) or a 12 MPix camera (MC124xG-SY-UB).  Which camera(s) are you referring to? Lenses: we loaned you a 16mm lens and a 35mm lens (I believe). Which of the lenses would you need? Are substitutes allowed (the 35mm lens is very expensive…) Do you also want me to quote cables (USB3 and Sync cables) and mounting brackets?   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517        Mike,       We need two monochrome cameras with lenses, and a color camera (same configurations you’d provided as a loaner earlier).  Can you please let us know how we can make a purchase?         To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         Hello Mike,   Apologies, I was under the impression the order for a monochrome (2) and one colour had already been made. Do let me know the process to add the above to our earlier order.       Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hi Hemdeep,   I don’t see any orders in our system other than the loan cameras you have in your possession right now. Can you tell me which order you are referring to, and where  you sent the order?   Best,   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Hello Mike,   Just following up on the camera delivery, namely the 2 monochrome and 1 colour ones.

We are running against a tight timeline, and since we are not sure  about the right fit, it would be good to test both the camera systems at once. We can return one of these immediately after our tests which shouldn’t take longer than a few days. Additionally, may I request to ship the camera and lens as soon as possible while  we wait for the inputs on strobe light from Mike?   Thanks.      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hi Vivek, the 16mm lens I have will not cover the 12 Mpixel sensor very well. The lens is designed for a 2/3” sensor, and the 12 Mpixel sensor is 1.1”, so  coverage at the edges will not be good. But, it would be adequate if you made a ROI for the center 5 Mpixels. I do have one lens that will cover the entire 12 Mpixel sensor, but it is a 35mm lens and may be the wrong focal length for you. Let me know what  you think of all this and if one configuration or the other sounds better. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the prompt response. This is the last piece of puzzle we need to solve before we can present the solution out in front of the customer. To close  this quickly and move to the production phase with them, time is of essence and as such anything you could do to expedite the lighting setup would go a long way.   Kevin,   We want to try out the model “MC124MG-SY-UB” with a 16mm lens as you have suggested given the availability conditions. I am assuming the dark edges you are  talking about will not cover more than 5% of the edges. Please let me know if this is not the case. Additionally, a 3m USB cable to go with it would be perfect. Would we need a power adapter too?   Ash will be sending out the address and the card information for processing shortly.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   Sure Mike, that would be great.

Please give me a few days to see what we can do.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517      Hello Kevin, Mike - Hope you are doing well, and had a relaxing weekend.       I am just checking in on the status of the lighting setup from the other manufacturer.

If mono, I have only a MC124MG-SY-UB camera available at the moment. You can make the ROI smaller to simulate the 5 Mpixel version as otherwise these cameras are  identical (same pixel size and operation). I have a 16mm lens that will cover the area the 5 Mpixel version would need, but it does not completely cover all 12 Mpixels, so you will see some dark edges when imaging with the whole focal plane. If you want a  color camera, I do have the 5 Mpixel version. Let me know what other accessories you’d like with the loan (a 3m USB cable is typical). I will need your complete contact information in including ship to address and phone number as well I’ll need a credit card  to back the loan. Please fill out the attached form with your credit card information. Once completed, please send it via the Dropbox link below. You may call me at 303-389-9838 x210 if you prefer.    https://www.dropbox.com/request/rWULiT1x0jP2bZCElJwI    Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517      Hi Kevin,   Do let us know when the loan camera with the lens will be ready for delivery. If you could provide us with a date, we could work towards it.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Hi Vivek, I do have a 16mm lens that should cover our MC050MG camera. I’ll work with you to put a loan together when ready. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed insights. This sounds exciting.   Please find my answers inline in BLUE.     Kevin,   Nice to meet you. Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of  the box (middle of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to  give you a range of focal lengths for the distance you gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a  correction of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I  think we can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens. Please let me know if you require any additional details.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Thank you, Mike. We'll confirm the FOV by early tomorrow.          To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    (+ Kevin)   Hi Ash,   I am adding Kevin to the thread, as he is managing our camera loan program. I have to check what we can do about the strobe  light. We don’t typically sell those, so we don’t have them as loan items either. But I will check and let you know.   The items you would need for your test are:   MC023MG-SY-UB (this is a monochrome camera) We can add a zoom lens, but I need to know what the desired field of view is (i.e., the area that you can guarantee contains  the bar code). The focal length of the lens will depend on that size. A mounting bracket and a USB3 cable is not an issue. We should also have a trigger cable that you can use.   For the strobe light I have to wait until I hear back from the company that we end up getting them from.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Good morning and hope you had a great weekend.    Can you please send us the following camera, strobe, and associated peripherals for development / trial? If this works, this would convert into a 200+  camera deal to begin with and our footprint is massive on the current account, and growing heavily across the industry on a number of use case.     Camera Model: MC023MG-SY-UB with proper Zoom lens that can allow us to focus on moving carton on conveyer from a distance of about 36 to 48 inches Associated Strobe light that can be simultaneously triggered (either through Ximea or your partner) Proper camera mount that we can use   Associated peripherals   Below is the shipping address:   Ashutosh Prasad AMLI QUADRANGLE  2717 Howell St  APT #4114 DALLAS, TEXAS 75204    Additionally, we would also like to understand a bit more about the Xray and Hyperspectral cameras Ximea offers.   Please let me know in case of any questions.    @Hemdeep Ray  – Can you please send Mike our MNDA for signature? It would be good to have a MNDA in place as we jointly target large deals.   --  Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   We don’t make GigE cameras, as most of our customers must rely on getting images as fast as possible, and Ethernet networks can be clogged by other applications.    Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed overview. What you have articulated below looks great to me. We will do an internal review and revert with questions if any.   For the current use case, we have the option to connect the camera either over USB or Ethernet. Do you also have cameras that relay videos over LAN instead  of USB?      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517  Absolutely Mike, thanks a ton for this. I am also marking the rest of the team on this email so nobody misses anything.   Hi Ash, Vivek – Mike has provided some rough calculations based on the info we provided. Request you to take a look.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see  which of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and  use a lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar  codes(s) with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt,  and when the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple  voltage pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light  to see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code  is approx. 1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area  of the box. You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly  2,400 x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like  4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you  will need multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the  12 Mpixel (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.   Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:     TX2 carrier boards:  https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras  API information:   https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support  Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing  TX2 vs Xavier:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Nano_Benchmarks     Loan cameras:   We do have some of these cameras available as loan cameras, but my colleague Kevin is managing the loan program. I will get  him involved if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no  charges on the card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the  Jetson (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson.  We can also discuss that, if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

To summarize, here’s our current configuration:     Monochrome camera is being used with 35mm lens. We’d like to source both camera and lens (2 units each) from you.Color camera is being used with 12mm lens currently, but we’d like to also try the 16mm lens and observe which one’s better. We’d like to source the  color camera from you and can work with the lens partner for a 16mm lens loaner for our testing (they loaned us the 12mm lens while we’re establishing a reseller relationship).  We’d need cables and mounts for all three cameras.         To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --     Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Hi Ash,   I should be able to give you a few prices for lenses in a couple of days.   Let me do the following: I’ll separate out the quote for the lenses and send you the quote for the rest. Then follow up with information  about the lenses when I have it.   PoE: I assume you are talking about Power over Ethernet. That actually does not apply to the cameras, as they are not Ethernet cameras. However,  the cameras are powered over the USB3 connection (or the PCIe connection, depending on which version you use). So there is no need to supply them with power separately. If you use multiple cameras with a switch, you  will need a power supply for the switch,  the built-in power from the PCIe subsystem or USB3 subsystem is normally not sufficient to support multiple cameras. For USB3 the maximum power that can be drawn through the cable is 5W, and some cameras get close to that, so that multiple cameras would exceed  that.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517        Thanks Mike. That’d work.        For the color camera, we sourced lens from the partner you’d introduced. If you can provide us quote for the lens we used with the monochrome camera for the conveyer  belt use case, we can procure color camera lens directly from your partner as we did in the past for other use cases.       Additionally, is there a PoE version of these cameras for production deployment?         To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Of course. I am trying to get some prices for lenses. You have lenses that are wither not designed for the 12 MPix  cameras, or that are very expensive. I am currently  talking to our vendors to see what we can do about that. If you prefer, I can quote the lenses that we sent you.

We are running against a tight timeline, and since we are not sure  about the right fit, it would be good to test both the camera systems at once. We can return one of these immediately after our tests which shouldn’t take longer than a few days. Additionally, may I request to ship the camera and lens as soon as possible while  we wait for the inputs on strobe light from Mike?   Thanks.      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hi Vivek, the 16mm lens I have will not cover the 12 Mpixel sensor very well. The lens is designed for a 2/3” sensor, and the 12 Mpixel sensor is 1.1”, so coverage  at the edges will not be good. But, it would be adequate if you made a ROI for the center 5 Mpixels. I do have one lens that will cover the entire 12 Mpixel sensor, but it is a 35mm lens and may be the wrong focal length for you. Let me know what you think  of all this and if one configuration or the other sounds better. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the prompt response. This is the last piece of puzzle we need to solve before we can present the solution out in front of the customer. To close  this quickly and move to the production phase with them, time is of essence and as such anything you could do to expedite the lighting setup would go a long way.   Kevin,   We want to try out the model “MC124MG-SY-UB” with a 16mm lens as you have suggested given the availability conditions. I am assuming the dark edges you are  talking about will not cover more than 5% of the edges. Please let me know if this is not the case. Additionally, a 3m USB cable to go with it would be perfect. Would we need a power adapter too?   Ash will be sending out the address and the card information for processing shortly.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   Sure Mike, that would be great.

If mono, I have only a MC124MG-SY-UB camera available at the moment. You can make  the ROI smaller to simulate the 5 Mpixel version as otherwise these cameras are identical (same pixel size and operation). I have a 16mm lens that will cover the area the 5 Mpixel version would need, but it does not completely cover all 12 Mpixels, so you  will see some dark edges when imaging with the whole focal plane. If you want a color camera, I do have the 5 Mpixel version. Let me know what other accessories you’d like with the loan (a 3m USB cable is typical). I will need your complete contact information  in including ship to address and phone number as well I’ll need a credit card to back the loan.

If you could provide us with a date, we could work towards it.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Hi Vivek, I do have a 16mm lens that should cover our MC050MG camera. I’ll work with you to put a loan together when ready. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed insights. This sounds exciting.   Please find my answers inline in BLUE.     Kevin,   Nice to meet you. Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the  box (middle of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give  you a range of focal lengths for the distance you gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction  of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think  we can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens. Please let me know if you require any additional details.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Thank you, Mike. We'll confirm the FOV by early tomorrow.          To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    (+ Kevin)   Hi Ash,   I am adding Kevin to the thread, as he is managing our camera loan program. I have to check what we can do about the strobe  light. We don’t typically sell those, so we don’t have them as loan items either. But I will check and let you know.   The items you would need for your test are:   MC023MG-SY-UB (this is a monochrome camera) We can add a zoom lens, but I need to know what the desired field of view is (i.e., the area that you can guarantee contains  the bar code). The focal length of the lens will depend on that size. A mounting bracket and a USB3 cable is not an issue. We should also have a trigger cable that you can use.   For the strobe light I have to wait until I hear back from the company that we end up getting them from.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Good morning and hope you had a great weekend.    Can you please send us the following camera, strobe, and associated peripherals for development / trial? If this works, this would convert into a 200+ camera  deal to begin with and our footprint is massive on the current account, and growing heavily across the industry on a number of use case.     Camera Model: MC023MG-SY-UB with proper Zoom lens that can allow us to focus on moving carton on conveyer from a distance of about 36 to 48 inches Associated Strobe light that can be simultaneously triggered (either through Ximea or your partner) Proper camera mount that we can use   Associated peripherals   Below is the shipping address:   Ashutosh Prasad AMLI QUADRANGLE  2717 Howell St  APT #4114 DALLAS, TEXAS 75204    Additionally, we would also like to understand a bit more about the Xray and Hyperspectral cameras Ximea offers.   Please let me know in case of any questions.    @Hemdeep Ray  – Can you please send Mike our MNDA for signature? It would be good to have a MNDA in place as we jointly target large deals.   --  Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   We don’t make GigE cameras, as most of our customers must rely on getting images as fast as possible, and Ethernet networks can be clogged by other applications.    Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed overview. What you have articulated below looks great to me. We will do an internal review and revert with questions if any.   For the current use case, we have the option to connect the camera either over USB or Ethernet. Do you also have cameras that relay videos over LAN instead  of USB?      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517  Absolutely Mike, thanks a ton for this. I am also marking the rest of the team on this email so nobody misses anything.   Hi Ash, Vivek – Mike has provided some rough calculations based on the info we provided. Request you to take a look.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see  which of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and  use a lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s)  with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and  when the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to  see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is  approx. 1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of  the box. You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly  2,400 x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like  4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will  need multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel  (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.   Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:     TX2 carrier boards:  https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras  API information:   https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support  Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing  TX2 vs Xavier:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Nano_Benchmarks     Loan cameras:   We do have some of these cameras available as loan cameras, but my colleague Kevin is managing the loan program. I will get  him involved if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no  charges on the card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the  Jetson (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson.  We can also discuss that, if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

We’d need cables and mounts for all three cameras.         To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Hi Ash,   I should be able to give you a few prices for lenses in a couple of days.   Let me do the following: I’ll separate out the quote for the lenses and send you the quote for the rest. Then follow up with information about  the lenses when I have it.   PoE: I assume you are talking about Power over Ethernet. That actually does not apply to the cameras, as they are not Ethernet cameras. However,  the cameras are powered over the USB3 connection (or the PCIe connection, depending on which version you use). So there is no need to supply them with power separately. If you use multiple cameras with a switch, you  will need a power supply for the switch,  the built-in power from the PCIe subsystem or USB3 subsystem is normally not sufficient to support multiple cameras. For USB3 the maximum power that can be drawn through the cable is 5W, and some cameras get close to that, so that multiple cameras would exceed  that.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517        Thanks Mike. That’d work.        For the color camera, we sourced lens from the partner you’d introduced. If you can provide us quote for the lens we used with the monochrome camera for the conveyer belt  use case, we can procure color camera lens directly from your partner as we did in the past for other use cases.       Additionally, is there a PoE version of these cameras for production deployment?         To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Of course. I am trying to get some prices for lenses. You have lenses that are wither not designed for the 12 MPix  cameras, or that are very expensive. I am currently  talking to our vendors to see what we can do about that. If you prefer, I can quote the lenses that we sent you.

We are running against a tight timeline, and since we are not sure about  the right fit, it would be good to test both the camera systems at once. We can return one of these immediately after our tests which shouldn’t take longer than a few days. Additionally, may I request to ship the camera and lens as soon as possible while we  wait for the inputs on strobe light from Mike?   Thanks.      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hi Vivek, the 16mm lens I have will not cover the 12 Mpixel sensor very well. The lens is designed for a 2/3” sensor, and the 12 Mpixel sensor is 1.1”, so coverage  at the edges will not be good. But, it would be adequate if you made a ROI for the center 5 Mpixels. I do have one lens that will cover the entire 12 Mpixel sensor, but it is a 35mm lens and may be the wrong focal length for you. Let me know what you think  of all this and if one configuration or the other sounds better. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the prompt response. This is the last piece of puzzle we need to solve before we can present the solution out in front of the customer. To close  this quickly and move to the production phase with them, time is of essence and as such anything you could do to expedite the lighting setup would go a long way.   Kevin,   We want to try out the model “MC124MG-SY-UB” with a 16mm lens as you have suggested given the availability conditions. I am assuming the dark edges you are talking  about will not cover more than 5% of the edges. Please let me know if this is not the case. Additionally, a 3m USB cable to go with it would be perfect. Would we need a power adapter too?   Ash will be sending out the address and the card information for processing shortly.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   Sure Mike, that would be great.

If mono, I have only a MC124MG-SY-UB camera available at the moment. You can make the  ROI smaller to simulate the 5 Mpixel version as otherwise these cameras are identical (same pixel size and operation). I have a 16mm lens that will cover the area the 5 Mpixel version would need, but it does not completely cover all 12 Mpixels, so you will  see some dark edges when imaging with the whole focal plane. If you want a color camera, I do have the 5 Mpixel version. Let me know what other accessories you’d like with the loan (a 3m USB cable is typical). I will need your complete contact information  in including ship to address and phone number as well I’ll need a credit card to back the loan.

Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Hi Vivek, I do have a 16mm lens that should cover our MC050MG camera. I’ll work with you to put a loan together when ready. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed insights. This sounds exciting.   Please find my answers inline in BLUE.     Kevin,   Nice to meet you. Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the  box (middle of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give  you a range of focal lengths for the distance you gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction  of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think  we can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens. Please let me know if you require any additional details.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Thank you, Mike. We'll confirm the FOV by early tomorrow.          To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    (+ Kevin)   Hi Ash,   I am adding Kevin to the thread, as he is managing our camera loan program. I have to check what we can do about the strobe light.  We don’t typically sell those, so we don’t have them as loan items either. But I will check and let you know.   The items you would need for your test are:   MC023MG-SY-UB (this is a monochrome camera) We can add a zoom lens, but I need to know what the desired field of view is (i.e., the area that you can guarantee contains  the bar code). The focal length of the lens will depend on that size. A mounting bracket and a USB3 cable is not an issue. We should also have a trigger cable that you can use.   For the strobe light I have to wait until I hear back from the company that we end up getting them from.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Good morning and hope you had a great weekend.    Can you please send us the following camera, strobe, and associated peripherals for development / trial?

What you have articulated below looks great to me. We will do an internal review and revert with questions if any.   For the current use case, we have the option to connect the camera either over USB or Ethernet. Do you also have cameras that relay videos over LAN instead  of USB?      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517  Absolutely Mike, thanks a ton for this. I am also marking the rest of the team on this email so nobody misses anything.   Hi Ash, Vivek – Mike has provided some rough calculations based on the info we provided. Request you to take a look.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which  of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use  a lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s)  with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and  when the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to  see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx.  1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box.  You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400  x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000  x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will  need multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel  (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.   Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Nano_Benchmarks     Loan cameras:   We do have some of these cameras available as loan cameras, but my colleague Kevin is managing the loan program. I will get him  involved if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges  on the card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson  (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can  also discuss that, if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

"Hello Kevin,   I hope you are doing well.  We would like to order one 16mm Lens on an urgent basis as a loaner. Would you please initiate the process and share the details of the shipment with us?  Look forward to your response.             Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517       Hello Kevin,   Thanks for the note and the update. I have asked the team on the way forward with the 12mm lens and the camera quotes (QUO-0011162)  sent earlier.    I will get back to you shortly. Meanwhile, I have asked Nicole if QUO-0011162 expiry can be put on hold for 24 hours while the team gets back to me.       Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hi Hemdeep, quote inbound and loans extended to July 8. For clarity, we have no cameras on order for you right now…       Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Kevin,   Slight change in the Lens quote due to some changes in requirement.    We will require  one Computar Lens – V1228-MPY2 – 1.1” 12mm F2.8 12 Megapixel (C Mount) Machine Vision Lens ASAP. Would be great if you could send us a revised Lens quote for only this based on the description.    Additionally, any light you can shed on the loaner extension would be helpful as well.       Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517  Hello Kevin,   Thanks for the quotes. Meanwhile, based on Ash’s query, will it be possible to extend the current loaners for another 45 days till we procure addl. cameras?      Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517  Thanks Kevin. We’re in the final leg for the first use case. If you can extend the loan by a month while we work on procuring additional cameras, that would be a great help.    To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader   --  Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hi Ashutosh, your loans have expired, but I can renew again if you need? Just let me know…   Kevin      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517        Mike,       Correction. We’re using color camera with the 16mm lens currently, and need to secure 12mm lens as a loaner from your partner.         To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517          Thanks Mike. To summarize, here’s our current configuration:     Monochrome camera is being used with 35mm lens. We’d like to source both camera and lens (2 units each) from you.Color camera is being used with 12mm lens currently, but we’d like to also try the 16mm lens and observe which one’s better. We’d like to source the color  camera from you and can work with the lens partner for a 16mm lens loaner for our testing (they loaned us the 12mm lens while we’re establishing a reseller relationship).  We’d need cables and mounts for all three cameras.         To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Hi Ash,   I should be able to give you a few prices for lenses in a couple of days.   Let me do the following: I’ll separate out the quote for the lenses and send you the quote for the rest. Then follow up with information about  the lenses when I have it.   PoE: I assume you are talking about Power over Ethernet. That actually does not apply to the cameras, as they are not Ethernet cameras. However,  the cameras are powered over the USB3 connection (or the PCIe connection, depending on which version you use). So there is no need to supply them with power separately. If you use multiple cameras with a switch, you  will need a power supply for the switch,  the built-in power from the PCIe subsystem or USB3 subsystem is normally not sufficient to support multiple cameras. For USB3 the maximum power that can be drawn through the cable is 5W, and some cameras get close to that, so that multiple cameras would exceed  that.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517        Thanks Mike. That’d work.        For the color camera, we sourced lens from the partner you’d introduced. If you can provide us quote for the lens we used with the monochrome camera for the conveyer belt  use case, we can procure color camera lens directly from your partner as we did in the past for other use cases.       Additionally, is there a PoE version of these cameras for production deployment?         To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Of course. I am trying to get some prices for lenses. You have lenses that are wither not designed for the 12 MPix  cameras, or that are very expensive. I am currently talking  to our vendors to see what we can do about that. If you prefer, I can quote the lenses that we sent you. Should I do that?      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Hello Mike,   Just following up on this. Do let me know how we should go about closing.

I can set that up, but I want to make sure I quote the  right products.   You mention 2 color and 1 monochrome camera. Based on the loan documents, that could be either a 5 MPix camera (MC050xG-SY-UB) or a 12 MPix camera (MC124xG-SY-UB). Which  camera(s) are you referring to? Lenses: we loaned you a 16mm lens and a 35mm lens (I believe). Which of the lenses would you need? Are substitutes allowed (the 35mm lens is very expensive…) Do you also want me to quote cables (USB3 and Sync cables) and mounting brackets?   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517        Mike,       We need two monochrome cameras with lenses, and a color camera (same configurations you’d provided as a loaner earlier).

We are running against a tight timeline, and since we are not sure about  the right fit, it would be good to test both the camera systems at once. We can return one of these immediately after our tests which shouldn’t take longer than a few days. Additionally, may I request to ship the camera and lens as soon as possible while we  wait for the inputs on strobe light from Mike?   Thanks.      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hi Vivek, the 16mm lens I have will not cover the 12 Mpixel sensor very well. The lens is designed for a 2/3” sensor, and the 12 Mpixel sensor is 1.1”, so coverage  at the edges will not be good. But, it would be adequate if you made a ROI for the center 5 Mpixels. I do have one lens that will cover the entire 12 Mpixel sensor, but it is a 35mm lens and may be the wrong focal length for you. Let me know what you think  of all this and if one configuration or the other sounds better. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the prompt response. This is the last piece of puzzle we need to solve before we can present the solution out in front of the customer. To close this  quickly and move to the production phase with them, time is of essence and as such anything you could do to expedite the lighting setup would go a long way.   Kevin,   We want to try out the model “MC124MG-SY-UB” with a 16mm lens as you have suggested given the availability conditions. I am assuming the dark edges you are talking  about will not cover more than 5% of the edges. Please let me know if this is not the case. Additionally, a 3m USB cable to go with it would be perfect. Would we need a power adapter too?   Ash will be sending out the address and the card information for processing shortly.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   Sure Mike, that would be great.

If mono, I have only a MC124MG-SY-UB camera available at the moment. You can make the  ROI smaller to simulate the 5 Mpixel version as otherwise these cameras are identical (same pixel size and operation). I have a 16mm lens that will cover the area the 5 Mpixel version would need, but it does not completely cover all 12 Mpixels, so you will  see some dark edges when imaging with the whole focal plane. If you want a color camera, I do have the 5 Mpixel version. Let me know what other accessories you’d like with the loan (a 3m USB cable is typical). I will need your complete contact information  in including ship to address and phone number as well I’ll need a credit card to back the loan. Please fill out the attached form with your credit card information. Once completed, please send it via the Dropbox link below.

This sounds exciting.   Please find my answers inline in BLUE.     Kevin,   Nice to meet you. Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box  (middle of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give  you a range of focal lengths for the distance you gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction  of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think  we can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens. Please let me know if you require any additional details.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Thank you, Mike. We'll confirm the FOV by early tomorrow.          To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    (+ Kevin)   Hi Ash,   I am adding Kevin to the thread, as he is managing our camera loan program. I have to check what we can do about the strobe light.  We don’t typically sell those, so we don’t have them as loan items either. But I will check and let you know.   The items you would need for your test are:   MC023MG-SY-UB (this is a monochrome camera) We can add a zoom lens, but I need to know what the desired field of view is (i.e., the area that you can guarantee contains the  bar code). The focal length of the lens will depend on that size. A mounting bracket and a USB3 cable is not an issue. We should also have a trigger cable that you can use.   For the strobe light I have to wait until I hear back from the company that we end up getting them from.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Good morning and hope you had a great weekend.    Can you please send us the following camera, strobe, and associated peripherals for development / trial? If this works, this would convert into a 200+ camera  deal to begin with and our footprint is massive on the current account, and growing heavily across the industry on a number of use case.     Camera Model: MC023MG-SY-UB with proper Zoom lens that can allow us to focus on moving carton on conveyer from a distance of about 36 to 48 inches Associated Strobe light that can be simultaneously triggered (either through Ximea or your partner) Proper camera mount that we can use   Associated peripherals   Below is the shipping address:   Ashutosh Prasad AMLI QUADRANGLE  2717 Howell St  APT #4114 DALLAS, TEXAS 75204    Additionally, we would also like to understand a bit more about the Xray and Hyperspectral cameras Ximea offers.   Please let me know in case of any questions.    @Hemdeep Ray  – Can you please send Mike our MNDA for signature? It would be good to have a MNDA in place as we jointly target large deals.   --  Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   We don’t make GigE cameras, as most of our customers must rely on getting images as fast as possible, and Ethernet networks can be clogged by other applications.    Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed overview. What you have articulated below looks great to me. We will do an internal review and revert with questions if any.   For the current use case, we have the option to connect the camera either over USB or Ethernet. Do you also have cameras that relay videos over LAN instead  of USB?      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517  Absolutely Mike, thanks a ton for this. I am also marking the rest of the team on this email so nobody misses anything.   Hi Ash, Vivek – Mike has provided some rough calculations based on the info we provided. Request you to take a look.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which  of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use  a lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s)  with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when  the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to  see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx.  1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box.  You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400  x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000  x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will  need multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel  (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.   Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Nano_Benchmarks     Loan cameras:   We do have some of these cameras available as loan cameras, but my colleague Kevin is managing the loan program. I will get him  involved if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges  on the card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson  (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can  also discuss that, if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

Then follow up with information about the  lenses when I have it.   PoE: I assume you are talking about Power over Ethernet. That actually does not apply to the cameras, as they are not Ethernet cameras. However,  the cameras are powered over the USB3 connection (or the PCIe connection, depending on which version you use). So there is no need to supply them with power separately. If you use multiple cameras with a switch, you  will need a power supply for the switch,  the built-in power from the PCIe subsystem or USB3 subsystem is normally not sufficient to support multiple cameras. For USB3 the maximum power that can be drawn through the cable is 5W, and some cameras get close to that, so that multiple cameras would exceed  that.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517        Thanks Mike. That’d work.        For the color camera, we sourced lens from the partner you’d introduced. If you can provide us quote for the lens we used with the monochrome camera for the conveyer belt use  case, we can procure color camera lens directly from your partner as we did in the past for other use cases.       Additionally, is there a PoE version of these cameras for production deployment?         To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Of course.

We are running against a tight timeline, and since we are not sure about  the right fit, it would be good to test both the camera systems at once. We can return one of these immediately after our tests which shouldn’t take longer than a few days. Additionally, may I request to ship the camera and lens as soon as possible while we  wait for the inputs on strobe light from Mike?   Thanks.      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hi Vivek, the 16mm lens I have will not cover the 12 Mpixel sensor very well. The lens is designed for a 2/3” sensor, and the 12 Mpixel sensor is 1.1”, so coverage  at the edges will not be good. But, it would be adequate if you made a ROI for the center 5 Mpixels. I do have one lens that will cover the entire 12 Mpixel sensor, but it is a 35mm lens and may be the wrong focal length for you. Let me know what you think  of all this and if one configuration or the other sounds better. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the prompt response. This is the last piece of puzzle we need to solve before we can present the solution out in front of the customer. To close this  quickly and move to the production phase with them, time is of essence and as such anything you could do to expedite the lighting setup would go a long way.   Kevin,   We want to try out the model “MC124MG-SY-UB” with a 16mm lens as you have suggested given the availability conditions. I am assuming the dark edges you are talking  about will not cover more than 5% of the edges. Please let me know if this is not the case. Additionally, a 3m USB cable to go with it would be perfect. Would we need a power adapter too?   Ash will be sending out the address and the card information for processing shortly.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   Sure Mike, that would be great.

If mono, I have only a MC124MG-SY-UB camera available at the moment. You can make the ROI  smaller to simulate the 5 Mpixel version as otherwise these cameras are identical (same pixel size and operation). I have a 16mm lens that will cover the area the 5 Mpixel version would need, but it does not completely cover all 12 Mpixels, so you will see  some dark edges when imaging with the whole focal plane. If you want a color camera, I do have the 5 Mpixel version. Let me know what other accessories you’d like with the loan (a 3m USB cable is typical). I will need your complete contact information in including  ship to address and phone number as well I’ll need a credit card to back the loan.

If you could provide us with a date, we could work towards it.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Hi Vivek, I do have a 16mm lens that should cover our MC050MG camera. I’ll work with you to put a loan together when ready. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed insights. This sounds exciting.   Please find my answers inline in BLUE.     Kevin,   Nice to meet you. Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box  (middle of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you  a range of focal lengths for the distance you gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction  of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we  can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens. Please let me know if you require any additional details.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Thank you, Mike. We'll confirm the FOV by early tomorrow.          To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    (+ Kevin)   Hi Ash,   I am adding Kevin to the thread, as he is managing our camera loan program. I have to check what we can do about the strobe light.  We don’t typically sell those, so we don’t have them as loan items either. But I will check and let you know.   The items you would need for your test are:   MC023MG-SY-UB (this is a monochrome camera) We can add a zoom lens, but I need to know what the desired field of view is (i.e., the area that you can guarantee contains the bar  code). The focal length of the lens will depend on that size. A mounting bracket and a USB3 cable is not an issue. We should also have a trigger cable that you can use.   For the strobe light I have to wait until I hear back from the company that we end up getting them from.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Good morning and hope you had a great weekend.    Can you please send us the following camera, strobe, and associated peripherals for development / trial? If this works, this would convert into a 200+ camera  deal to begin with and our footprint is massive on the current account, and growing heavily across the industry on a number of use case.     Camera Model: MC023MG-SY-UB with proper Zoom lens that can allow us to focus on moving carton on conveyer from a distance of about 36 to 48 inches Associated Strobe light that can be simultaneously triggered (either through Ximea or your partner) Proper camera mount that we can use   Associated peripherals   Below is the shipping address:   Ashutosh Prasad AMLI QUADRANGLE  2717 Howell St  APT #4114 DALLAS, TEXAS 75204    Additionally, we would also like to understand a bit more about the Xray and Hyperspectral cameras Ximea offers.   Please let me know in case of any questions.    @Hemdeep Ray  – Can you please send Mike our MNDA for signature? It would be good to have a MNDA in place as we jointly target large deals.   --  Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   We don’t make GigE cameras, as most of our customers must rely on getting images as fast as possible, and Ethernet networks can be clogged by other applications.    Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed overview. What you have articulated below looks great to me. We will do an internal review and revert with questions if any.   For the current use case, we have the option to connect the camera either over USB or Ethernet. Do you also have cameras that relay videos over LAN instead of  USB?      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517  Absolutely Mike, thanks a ton for this. I am also marking the rest of the team on this email so nobody misses anything.   Hi Ash, Vivek – Mike has provided some rough calculations based on the info we provided. Request you to take a look.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which  of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a  lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s)  with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when  the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to  see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx.  1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box.  You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x  1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000  x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need  multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel  (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.   Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Nano_Benchmarks     Loan cameras:   We do have some of these cameras available as loan cameras, but my colleague Kevin is managing the loan program. I will get him involved  if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the  card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson  (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can  also discuss that, if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

For clarity, we have no cameras on order for you right now…       Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Kevin,   Slight change in the Lens quote due to some changes in requirement.    We will require  one Computar Lens – V1228-MPY2 – 1.1” 12mm F2.8 12 Megapixel (C Mount) Machine Vision Lens ASAP. Would be great if you could send us a revised Lens quote for only this based on the description.    Additionally, any light you can shed on the loaner extension would be helpful as well.       Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517  Hello Kevin,   Thanks for the quotes. Meanwhile, based on Ash’s query, will it be possible to extend the current loaners for another 45 days till we procure addl. cameras?      Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517  Thanks Kevin. We’re in the final leg for the first use case. If you can extend the loan by a month while we work on procuring additional cameras, that would be a great help.    To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader   --  Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hi Ashutosh, your loans have expired, but I can renew again if you need? Just let me know…   Kevin      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517        Mike,       Correction. We’re using color camera with the 16mm lens currently, and need to secure 12mm lens as a loaner from your partner.         To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517          Thanks Mike. To summarize, here’s our current configuration:      Monochrome camera is being used with 35mm lens. We’d like to source both camera and lens (2 units each) from you. Color camera is being used with 12mm lens currently, but we’d like to also try the 16mm lens and observe which one’s better. We’d like to source the color camera from you and can work with the lens partner for a 16mm  lens loaner for our testing (they loaned us the 12mm lens while we’re establishing a reseller relationship).  We’d need cables and mounts for all three cameras.         To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Hi Ash,   I should be able to give you a few prices for lenses in a couple of days.   Let me do the following: I’ll separate out the quote for the lenses and send you the quote for the rest. Then follow up with information about the  lenses when I have it.   PoE: I assume you are talking about Power over Ethernet. That actually does not apply to the cameras, as they are not Ethernet cameras. However,  the cameras are powered over the USB3 connection (or the PCIe connection, depending on which version you use). So there is no need to supply them with power separately. If you use multiple cameras with a switch, you  will need a power supply for the switch,  the built-in power from the PCIe subsystem or USB3 subsystem is normally not sufficient to support multiple cameras. For USB3 the maximum power that can be drawn through the cable is 5W, and some cameras get close to that, so that multiple cameras would exceed  that.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517        Thanks Mike. That’d work.        For the color camera, we sourced lens from the partner you’d introduced. If you can provide us quote for the lens we used with the monochrome camera for the conveyer belt use  case, we can procure color camera lens directly from your partner as we did in the past for other use cases.       Additionally, is there a PoE version of these cameras for production deployment?         To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Of course. I am trying to get some prices for lenses. You have lenses that are wither not designed for the 12 MPix  cameras, or that are very expensive. I am currently talking  to our vendors to see what we can do about that. If you prefer, I can quote the lenses that we sent you. Should I do that?      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Hello Mike,   Just following up on this. Do let me know how we should go about closing.

I can set that up, but I want to make sure I quote the  right products.   You mention 2 color and 1 monochrome camera. Based on the loan documents, that could be either a 5 MPix camera (MC050xG-SY-UB) or a 12 MPix camera (MC124xG-SY-UB). Which  camera(s) are you referring to? Lenses: we loaned you a 16mm lens and a 35mm lens (I believe). Which of the lenses would you need? Are substitutes allowed (the 35mm lens is very expensive…) Do you also want me to quote cables (USB3 and Sync cables) and mounting brackets?   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517        Mike,       We need two monochrome cameras with lenses, and a color camera (same configurations you’d provided as a loaner earlier).

We are running against a tight timeline, and since we are not sure about  the right fit, it would be good to test both the camera systems at once. We can return one of these immediately after our tests which shouldn’t take longer than a few days. Additionally, may I request to ship the camera and lens as soon as possible while we  wait for the inputs on strobe light from Mike?   Thanks.      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hi Vivek, the 16mm lens I have will not cover the 12 Mpixel sensor very well. The lens is designed for a 2/3” sensor, and the 12 Mpixel sensor is 1.1”, so coverage  at the edges will not be good. But, it would be adequate if you made a ROI for the center 5 Mpixels. I do have one lens that will cover the entire 12 Mpixel sensor, but it is a 35mm lens and may be the wrong focal length for you. Let me know what you think  of all this and if one configuration or the other sounds better. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the prompt response. This is the last piece of puzzle we need to solve before we can present the solution out in front of the customer. To close this  quickly and move to the production phase with them, time is of essence and as such anything you could do to expedite the lighting setup would go a long way.   Kevin,   We want to try out the model “MC124MG-SY-UB” with a 16mm lens as you have suggested given the availability conditions. I am assuming the dark edges you are talking  about will not cover more than 5% of the edges. Please let me know if this is not the case. Additionally, a 3m USB cable to go with it would be perfect. Would we need a power adapter too?   Ash will be sending out the address and the card information for processing shortly.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   Sure Mike, that would be great.

If mono, I have only a MC124MG-SY-UB camera available at the moment. You can make the ROI  smaller to simulate the 5 Mpixel version as otherwise these cameras are identical (same pixel size and operation). I have a 16mm lens that will cover the area the 5 Mpixel version would need, but it does not completely cover all 12 Mpixels, so you will see  some dark edges when imaging with the whole focal plane. If you want a color camera, I do have the 5 Mpixel version. Let me know what other accessories you’d like with the loan (a 3m USB cable is typical). I will need your complete contact information in including  ship to address and phone number as well I’ll need a credit card to back the loan.

Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Hi Vivek, I do have a 16mm lens that should cover our MC050MG camera. I’ll work with you to put a loan together when ready. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed insights. This sounds exciting.   Please find my answers inline in BLUE.     Kevin,   Nice to meet you. Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box  (middle of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you  a range of focal lengths for the distance you gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction  of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we  can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens. Please let me know if you require any additional details.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Thank you, Mike. We'll confirm the FOV by early tomorrow.          To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    (+ Kevin)   Hi Ash,   I am adding Kevin to the thread, as he is managing our camera loan program. I have to check what we can do about the strobe light.  We don’t typically sell those, so we don’t have them as loan items either. But I will check and let you know.   The items you would need for your test are:   MC023MG-SY-UB (this is a monochrome camera) We can add a zoom lens, but I need to know what the desired field of view is (i.e., the area that you can guarantee contains the bar  code). The focal length of the lens will depend on that size. A mounting bracket and a USB3 cable is not an issue. We should also have a trigger cable that you can use.   For the strobe light I have to wait until I hear back from the company that we end up getting them from.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Good morning and hope you had a great weekend.    Can you please send us the following camera, strobe, and associated peripherals for development / trial?

What you have articulated below looks great to me. We will do an internal review and revert with questions if any.   For the current use case, we have the option to connect the camera either over USB or Ethernet. Do you also have cameras that relay videos over LAN instead of  USB?      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517  Absolutely Mike, thanks a ton for this. I am also marking the rest of the team on this email so nobody misses anything.   Hi Ash, Vivek – Mike has provided some rough calculations based on the info we provided. Request you to take a look.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which  of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a  lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s)  with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when  the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to  see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx.  1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box.  You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x  1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000  x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need  multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel  (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.   Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Nano_Benchmarks     Loan cameras:   We do have some of these cameras available as loan cameras, but my colleague Kevin is managing the loan program. I will get him involved  if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the  card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson  (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can  also discuss that, if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

"Hello Kevin,   Thanks for the note and the update. I have asked the team on the way forward with the 12mm lens and the camera quotes (QUO-0011162)  sent earlier.    I will get back to you shortly. Meanwhile, I have asked Nicole if QUO-0011162 expiry can be put on hold for 24 hours while the team gets back to me.       Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hi Hemdeep, quote inbound and loans extended to July 8. For clarity, we have no cameras on order for you right now…       Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Kevin,   Slight change in the Lens quote due to some changes in requirement.    We will require  one Computar Lens – V1228-MPY2 – 1.1” 12mm F2.8 12 Megapixel (C Mount) Machine Vision Lens ASAP. Would be great if you could send us a revised Lens quote for only this based on the description.    Additionally, any light you can shed on the loaner extension would be helpful as well.       Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517  Hello Kevin,   Thanks for the quotes. Meanwhile, based on Ash’s query, will it be possible to extend the current loaners for another 45 days till we procure addl. cameras?      Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517  Thanks Kevin. We’re in the final leg for the first use case. If you can extend the loan by a month while we work on procuring additional cameras, that would be a great help.    To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader   --  Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hi Ashutosh, your loans have expired, but I can renew again if you need? Just let me know…   Kevin      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517        Mike,       Correction. We’re using color camera with the 16mm lens currently, and need to secure 12mm lens as a loaner from your partner.         To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517          Thanks Mike. To summarize, here’s our current configuration:      Monochrome camera is being used with 35mm lens. We’d like to source both camera and lens (2 units each) from you. Color camera is being used with 12mm lens currently, but we’d like to also try the 16mm lens and observe which one’s better. We’d like to source the color camera from you and can work with the lens partner for a 16mm  lens loaner for our testing (they loaned us the 12mm lens while we’re establishing a reseller relationship).  We’d need cables and mounts for all three cameras.         To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Hi Ash,   I should be able to give you a few prices for lenses in a couple of days.   Let me do the following: I’ll separate out the quote for the lenses and send you the quote for the rest. Then follow up with information about the  lenses when I have it.   PoE: I assume you are talking about Power over Ethernet. That actually does not apply to the cameras, as they are not Ethernet cameras. However,  the cameras are powered over the USB3 connection (or the PCIe connection, depending on which version you use). So there is no need to supply them with power separately. If you use multiple cameras with a switch, you  will need a power supply for the switch,  the built-in power from the PCIe subsystem or USB3 subsystem is normally not sufficient to support multiple cameras. For USB3 the maximum power that can be drawn through the cable is 5W, and some cameras get close to that, so that multiple cameras would exceed  that.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517        Thanks Mike. That’d work.        For the color camera, we sourced lens from the partner you’d introduced. If you can provide us quote for the lens we used with the monochrome camera for the conveyer belt use  case, we can procure color camera lens directly from your partner as we did in the past for other use cases.       Additionally, is there a PoE version of these cameras for production deployment?         To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Of course. I am trying to get some prices for lenses. You have lenses that are wither not designed for the 12 MPix  cameras, or that are very expensive. I am currently talking  to our vendors to see what we can do about that. If you prefer, I can quote the lenses that we sent you. Should I do that?      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Hello Mike,   Just following up on this. Do let me know how we should go about closing. Would be great if you could set us up with the correct quote and PO.       Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517  Hello Mike,   Please find below the new requirements summarised for ease:     Monochrome Camera (https://www.ximea.com/en/products/usb-31-gen-1-with-sony-cmos-xic/mc124mg-sy)     We will require 2 pieces       Colour Camera (https://www.ximea.com/en/products/usb-31-gen-1-with-sony-cmos-xic/mc124cg-sy)     We will require 1 piece       12mm, 16mm, and 35mm lenses Three USB 3.0 cables Three Mounting Brackets   Do let us know how to proceed with this order.       Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517       Mike,       We’ll send over the specs of what we’re using.

I can set that up, but I want to make sure I quote the  right products.   You mention 2 color and 1 monochrome camera. Based on the loan documents, that could be either a 5 MPix camera (MC050xG-SY-UB) or a 12 MPix camera (MC124xG-SY-UB). Which  camera(s) are you referring to? Lenses: we loaned you a 16mm lens and a 35mm lens (I believe). Which of the lenses would you need? Are substitutes allowed (the 35mm lens is very expensive…) Do you also want me to quote cables (USB3 and Sync cables) and mounting brackets?   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517        Mike,       We need two monochrome cameras with lenses, and a color camera (same configurations you’d provided as a loaner earlier).

We are running against a tight timeline, and since we are not sure about  the right fit, it would be good to test both the camera systems at once. We can return one of these immediately after our tests which shouldn’t take longer than a few days. Additionally, may I request to ship the camera and lens as soon as possible while we  wait for the inputs on strobe light from Mike?   Thanks.      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hi Vivek, the 16mm lens I have will not cover the 12 Mpixel sensor very well. The lens is designed for a 2/3” sensor, and the 12 Mpixel sensor is 1.1”, so coverage  at the edges will not be good. But, it would be adequate if you made a ROI for the center 5 Mpixels. I do have one lens that will cover the entire 12 Mpixel sensor, but it is a 35mm lens and may be the wrong focal length for you. Let me know what you think  of all this and if one configuration or the other sounds better. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the prompt response. This is the last piece of puzzle we need to solve before we can present the solution out in front of the customer. To close this  quickly and move to the production phase with them, time is of essence and as such anything you could do to expedite the lighting setup would go a long way.   Kevin,   We want to try out the model “MC124MG-SY-UB” with a 16mm lens as you have suggested given the availability conditions. I am assuming the dark edges you are talking  about will not cover more than 5% of the edges. Please let me know if this is not the case. Additionally, a 3m USB cable to go with it would be perfect. Would we need a power adapter too?   Ash will be sending out the address and the card information for processing shortly.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   Sure Mike, that would be great.

If mono, I have only a MC124MG-SY-UB camera available at the moment. You can make the ROI  smaller to simulate the 5 Mpixel version as otherwise these cameras are identical (same pixel size and operation). I have a 16mm lens that will cover the area the 5 Mpixel version would need, but it does not completely cover all 12 Mpixels, so you will see  some dark edges when imaging with the whole focal plane. If you want a color camera, I do have the 5 Mpixel version. Let me know what other accessories you’d like with the loan (a 3m USB cable is typical). I will need your complete contact information in including  ship to address and phone number as well I’ll need a credit card to back the loan.

If you could provide us with a date, we could work towards it.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Hi Vivek, I do have a 16mm lens that should cover our MC050MG camera. I’ll work with you to put a loan together when ready. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed insights. This sounds exciting.   Please find my answers inline in BLUE.     Kevin,   Nice to meet you. Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box  (middle of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you  a range of focal lengths for the distance you gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction  of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we  can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens. Please let me know if you require any additional details.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Thank you, Mike. We'll confirm the FOV by early tomorrow.          To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    (+ Kevin)   Hi Ash,   I am adding Kevin to the thread, as he is managing our camera loan program. I have to check what we can do about the strobe light.  We don’t typically sell those, so we don’t have them as loan items either. But I will check and let you know.   The items you would need for your test are:   MC023MG-SY-UB (this is a monochrome camera) We can add a zoom lens, but I need to know what the desired field of view is (i.e., the area that you can guarantee contains the bar  code). The focal length of the lens will depend on that size. A mounting bracket and a USB3 cable is not an issue. We should also have a trigger cable that you can use.   For the strobe light I have to wait until I hear back from the company that we end up getting them from.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Good morning and hope you had a great weekend.    Can you please send us the following camera, strobe, and associated peripherals for development / trial? If this works, this would convert into a 200+ camera  deal to begin with and our footprint is massive on the current account, and growing heavily across the industry on a number of use case.     Camera Model: MC023MG-SY-UB with proper Zoom lens that can allow us to focus on moving carton on conveyer from a distance of about 36 to 48 inches Associated Strobe light that can be simultaneously triggered (either through Ximea or your partner) Proper camera mount that we can use   Associated peripherals   Below is the shipping address:   Ashutosh Prasad AMLI QUADRANGLE  2717 Howell St  APT #4114 DALLAS, TEXAS 75204    Additionally, we would also like to understand a bit more about the Xray and Hyperspectral cameras Ximea offers.   Please let me know in case of any questions.    @Hemdeep Ray  – Can you please send Mike our MNDA for signature? It would be good to have a MNDA in place as we jointly target large deals.   --  Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   We don’t make GigE cameras, as most of our customers must rely on getting images as fast as possible, and Ethernet networks can be clogged by other applications.    Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed overview. What you have articulated below looks great to me. We will do an internal review and revert with questions if any.   For the current use case, we have the option to connect the camera either over USB or Ethernet. Do you also have cameras that relay videos over LAN instead of  USB?      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517  Absolutely Mike, thanks a ton for this. I am also marking the rest of the team on this email so nobody misses anything.   Hi Ash, Vivek – Mike has provided some rough calculations based on the info we provided. Request you to take a look.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which  of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a  lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s)  with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when  the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to  see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx.  1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box.  You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x  1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000  x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need  multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel  (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.   Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Nano_Benchmarks     Loan cameras:   We do have some of these cameras available as loan cameras, but my colleague Kevin is managing the loan program. I will get him involved  if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the  card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson  (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can  also discuss that, if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

Just let me know…   Kevin      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517        Mike,       Correction. We’re using color camera with the 16mm lens currently, and need to secure 12mm lens as a loaner from your partner.         To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517          Thanks Mike. To summarize, here’s our current configuration:      Monochrome camera is being used with 35mm lens. We’d like to source both camera and lens (2 units each) from you. Color camera is being used with 12mm lens currently, but we’d like to also try the 16mm lens and observe which one’s better. We’d like to source the color camera from you and can work with the lens partner for a 16mm  lens loaner for our testing (they loaned us the 12mm lens while we’re establishing a reseller relationship).  We’d need cables and mounts for all three cameras.         To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Hi Ash,   I should be able to give you a few prices for lenses in a couple of days.   Let me do the following: I’ll separate out the quote for the lenses and send you the quote for the rest. Then follow up with information about the  lenses when I have it.   PoE: I assume you are talking about Power over Ethernet. That actually does not apply to the cameras, as they are not Ethernet cameras. However,  the cameras are powered over the USB3 connection (or the PCIe connection, depending on which version you use). So there is no need to supply them with power separately. If you use multiple cameras with a switch, you  will need a power supply for the switch,  the built-in power from the PCIe subsystem or USB3 subsystem is normally not sufficient to support multiple cameras. For USB3 the maximum power that can be drawn through the cable is 5W, and some cameras get close to that, so that multiple cameras would exceed  that.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517        Thanks Mike. That’d work.        For the color camera, we sourced lens from the partner you’d introduced. If you can provide us quote for the lens we used with the monochrome camera for the conveyer belt use  case, we can procure color camera lens directly from your partner as we did in the past for other use cases.       Additionally, is there a PoE version of these cameras for production deployment?         To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Of course.

We are running against a tight timeline, and since we are not sure about  the right fit, it would be good to test both the camera systems at once. We can return one of these immediately after our tests which shouldn’t take longer than a few days. Additionally, may I request to ship the camera and lens as soon as possible while we  wait for the inputs on strobe light from Mike?   Thanks.      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hi Vivek, the 16mm lens I have will not cover the 12 Mpixel sensor very well. The lens is designed for a 2/3” sensor, and the 12 Mpixel sensor is 1.1”, so coverage  at the edges will not be good. But, it would be adequate if you made a ROI for the center 5 Mpixels. I do have one lens that will cover the entire 12 Mpixel sensor, but it is a 35mm lens and may be the wrong focal length for you. Let me know what you think  of all this and if one configuration or the other sounds better. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the prompt response. This is the last piece of puzzle we need to solve before we can present the solution out in front of the customer. To close this  quickly and move to the production phase with them, time is of essence and as such anything you could do to expedite the lighting setup would go a long way.   Kevin,   We want to try out the model “MC124MG-SY-UB” with a 16mm lens as you have suggested given the availability conditions. I am assuming the dark edges you are talking  about will not cover more than 5% of the edges. Please let me know if this is not the case. Additionally, a 3m USB cable to go with it would be perfect. Would we need a power adapter too?   Ash will be sending out the address and the card information for processing shortly.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   Sure Mike, that would be great.

If mono, I have only a MC124MG-SY-UB camera available at the moment. You can make the ROI  smaller to simulate the 5 Mpixel version as otherwise these cameras are identical (same pixel size and operation). I have a 16mm lens that will cover the area the 5 Mpixel version would need, but it does not completely cover all 12 Mpixels, so you will see  some dark edges when imaging with the whole focal plane. If you want a color camera, I do have the 5 Mpixel version. Let me know what other accessories you’d like with the loan (a 3m USB cable is typical). I will need your complete contact information in including  ship to address and phone number as well I’ll need a credit card to back the loan.

If you could provide us with a date, we could work towards it.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Hi Vivek, I do have a 16mm lens that should cover our MC050MG camera. I’ll work with you to put a loan together when ready. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed insights. This sounds exciting.   Please find my answers inline in BLUE.     Kevin,   Nice to meet you. Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box  (middle of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you  a range of focal lengths for the distance you gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction  of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we  can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens. Please let me know if you require any additional details.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Thank you, Mike. We'll confirm the FOV by early tomorrow.          To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    (+ Kevin)   Hi Ash,   I am adding Kevin to the thread, as he is managing our camera loan program. I have to check what we can do about the strobe light.  We don’t typically sell those, so we don’t have them as loan items either. But I will check and let you know.   The items you would need for your test are:   MC023MG-SY-UB (this is a monochrome camera) We can add a zoom lens, but I need to know what the desired field of view is (i.e., the area that you can guarantee contains the bar  code). The focal length of the lens will depend on that size. A mounting bracket and a USB3 cable is not an issue. We should also have a trigger cable that you can use.   For the strobe light I have to wait until I hear back from the company that we end up getting them from.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Good morning and hope you had a great weekend.    Can you please send us the following camera, strobe, and associated peripherals for development / trial? If this works, this would convert into a 200+ camera  deal to begin with and our footprint is massive on the current account, and growing heavily across the industry on a number of use case.     Camera Model: MC023MG-SY-UB with proper Zoom lens that can allow us to focus on moving carton on conveyer from a distance of about 36 to 48 inches Associated Strobe light that can be simultaneously triggered (either through Ximea or your partner) Proper camera mount that we can use   Associated peripherals   Below is the shipping address:   Ashutosh Prasad AMLI QUADRANGLE  2717 Howell St  APT #4114 DALLAS, TEXAS 75204    Additionally, we would also like to understand a bit more about the Xray and Hyperspectral cameras Ximea offers.   Please let me know in case of any questions.    @Hemdeep Ray  – Can you please send Mike our MNDA for signature? It would be good to have a MNDA in place as we jointly target large deals.   --  Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   We don’t make GigE cameras, as most of our customers must rely on getting images as fast as possible, and Ethernet networks can be clogged by other applications.    Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed overview. What you have articulated below looks great to me. We will do an internal review and revert with questions if any.   For the current use case, we have the option to connect the camera either over USB or Ethernet. Do you also have cameras that relay videos over LAN instead of  USB?      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517  Absolutely Mike, thanks a ton for this. I am also marking the rest of the team on this email so nobody misses anything.   Hi Ash, Vivek – Mike has provided some rough calculations based on the info we provided. Request you to take a look.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which  of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a  lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s)  with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when  the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to  see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx.  1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box.  You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x  1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000  x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need  multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel  (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.   Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Nano_Benchmarks     Loan cameras:   We do have some of these cameras available as loan cameras, but my colleague Kevin is managing the loan program. I will get him involved  if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the  card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson  (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can  also discuss that, if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

We’d like to source the color camera from you and can work with the lens partner for a 16mm  lens loaner for our testing (they loaned us the 12mm lens while we’re establishing a reseller relationship).  We’d need cables and mounts for all three cameras.         To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Hi Ash,   I should be able to give you a few prices for lenses in a couple of days.   Let me do the following: I’ll separate out the quote for the lenses and send you the quote for the rest. Then follow up with information about the  lenses when I have it.   PoE: I assume you are talking about Power over Ethernet. That actually does not apply to the cameras, as they are not Ethernet cameras. However,  the cameras are powered over the USB3 connection (or the PCIe connection, depending on which version you use). So there is no need to supply them with power separately. If you use multiple cameras with a switch, you  will need a power supply for the switch,  the built-in power from the PCIe subsystem or USB3 subsystem is normally not sufficient to support multiple cameras. For USB3 the maximum power that can be drawn through the cable is 5W, and some cameras get close to that, so that multiple cameras would exceed  that.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517        Thanks Mike. That’d work.        For the color camera, we sourced lens from the partner you’d introduced. If you can provide us quote for the lens we used with the monochrome camera for the conveyer belt use  case, we can procure color camera lens directly from your partner as we did in the past for other use cases.       Additionally, is there a PoE version of these cameras for production deployment?         To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Of course. I am trying to get some prices for lenses. You have lenses that are wither not designed for the 12 MPix  cameras, or that are very expensive. I am currently talking  to our vendors to see what we can do about that. If you prefer, I can quote the lenses that we sent you. Should I do that?      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Hello Mike,   Just following up on this. Do let me know how we should go about closing.

I can set that up, but I want to make sure I quote the  right products.   You mention 2 color and 1 monochrome camera. Based on the loan documents, that could be either a 5 MPix camera (MC050xG-SY-UB) or a 12 MPix camera (MC124xG-SY-UB). Which  camera(s) are you referring to? Lenses: we loaned you a 16mm lens and a 35mm lens (I believe). Which of the lenses would you need? Are substitutes allowed (the 35mm lens is very expensive…) Do you also want me to quote cables (USB3 and Sync cables) and mounting brackets?   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517        Mike,       We need two monochrome cameras with lenses, and a color camera (same configurations you’d provided as a loaner earlier).

We are running against a tight timeline, and since we are not sure about  the right fit, it would be good to test both the camera systems at once. We can return one of these immediately after our tests which shouldn’t take longer than a few days. Additionally, may I request to ship the camera and lens as soon as possible while we  wait for the inputs on strobe light from Mike?   Thanks.      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hi Vivek, the 16mm lens I have will not cover the 12 Mpixel sensor very well. The lens is designed for a 2/3” sensor, and the 12 Mpixel sensor is 1.1”, so coverage  at the edges will not be good. But, it would be adequate if you made a ROI for the center 5 Mpixels. I do have one lens that will cover the entire 12 Mpixel sensor, but it is a 35mm lens and may be the wrong focal length for you. Let me know what you think  of all this and if one configuration or the other sounds better. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the prompt response. This is the last piece of puzzle we need to solve before we can present the solution out in front of the customer. To close this  quickly and move to the production phase with them, time is of essence and as such anything you could do to expedite the lighting setup would go a long way.   Kevin,   We want to try out the model “MC124MG-SY-UB” with a 16mm lens as you have suggested given the availability conditions. I am assuming the dark edges you are talking  about will not cover more than 5% of the edges. Please let me know if this is not the case. Additionally, a 3m USB cable to go with it would be perfect. Would we need a power adapter too?   Ash will be sending out the address and the card information for processing shortly.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   Sure Mike, that would be great.

If mono, I have only a MC124MG-SY-UB camera available at the moment. You can make the ROI  smaller to simulate the 5 Mpixel version as otherwise these cameras are identical (same pixel size and operation). I have a 16mm lens that will cover the area the 5 Mpixel version would need, but it does not completely cover all 12 Mpixels, so you will see  some dark edges when imaging with the whole focal plane. If you want a color camera, I do have the 5 Mpixel version. Let me know what other accessories you’d like with the loan (a 3m USB cable is typical). I will need your complete contact information in including  ship to address and phone number as well I’ll need a credit card to back the loan.

Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Hi Vivek, I do have a 16mm lens that should cover our MC050MG camera. I’ll work with you to put a loan together when ready. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed insights. This sounds exciting.   Please find my answers inline in BLUE.     Kevin,   Nice to meet you. Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box  (middle of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you  a range of focal lengths for the distance you gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction  of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we  can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens. Please let me know if you require any additional details.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Thank you, Mike. We'll confirm the FOV by early tomorrow.          To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    (+ Kevin)   Hi Ash,   I am adding Kevin to the thread, as he is managing our camera loan program. I have to check what we can do about the strobe light.  We don’t typically sell those, so we don’t have them as loan items either. But I will check and let you know.   The items you would need for your test are:   MC023MG-SY-UB (this is a monochrome camera) We can add a zoom lens, but I need to know what the desired field of view is (i.e., the area that you can guarantee contains the bar  code). The focal length of the lens will depend on that size. A mounting bracket and a USB3 cable is not an issue. We should also have a trigger cable that you can use.   For the strobe light I have to wait until I hear back from the company that we end up getting them from.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Good morning and hope you had a great weekend.    Can you please send us the following camera, strobe, and associated peripherals for development / trial? If this works, this would convert into a 200+ camera  deal to begin with and our footprint is massive on the current account, and growing heavily across the industry on a number of use case.     Camera Model: MC023MG-SY-UB with proper Zoom lens that can allow us to focus on moving carton on conveyer from a distance of about 36 to 48 inches Associated Strobe light that can be simultaneously triggered (either through Ximea or your partner) Proper camera mount that we can use   Associated peripherals   Below is the shipping address:   Ashutosh Prasad AMLI QUADRANGLE  2717 Howell St  APT #4114 DALLAS, TEXAS 75204    Additionally, we would also like to understand a bit more about the Xray and Hyperspectral cameras Ximea offers.   Please let me know in case of any questions.    @Hemdeep Ray  – Can you please send Mike our MNDA for signature? It would be good to have a MNDA in place as we jointly target large deals.   --  Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   We don’t make GigE cameras, as most of our customers must rely on getting images as fast as possible, and Ethernet networks can be clogged by other applications.    Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed overview. What you have articulated below looks great to me. We will do an internal review and revert with questions if any.   For the current use case, we have the option to connect the camera either over USB or Ethernet. Do you also have cameras that relay videos over LAN instead of  USB?      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517  Absolutely Mike, thanks a ton for this. I am also marking the rest of the team on this email so nobody misses anything.   Hi Ash, Vivek – Mike has provided some rough calculations based on the info we provided. Request you to take a look.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which  of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a  lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s)  with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when  the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to  see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx.  1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box.  You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x  1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000  x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need  multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel  (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.   Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Nano_Benchmarks     Loan cameras:   We do have some of these cameras available as loan cameras, but my colleague Kevin is managing the loan program. I will get him involved  if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the  card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson  (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can  also discuss that, if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

"Thanks Kevin. We’re in the final leg for the first use case. If you can extend the loan by a month while we work on procuring additional cameras, that would be a great help.    To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader   --  Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hi Ashutosh, your loans have expired, but I can renew again if you need? Just let me know…   Kevin      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517        Mike,       Correction. We’re using color camera with the 16mm lens currently, and need to secure 12mm lens as a loaner from your partner.         To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517          Thanks Mike. To summarize, here’s our current configuration:      Monochrome camera is being used with 35mm lens. We’d like to source both camera and lens (2 units each) from you. Color camera is being used with 12mm lens currently, but we’d like to also try the 16mm lens and observe which one’s better. We’d like to source the color camera from you and can work with the lens partner for a 16mm lens loaner for our testing (they loaned  us the 12mm lens while we’re establishing a reseller relationship).  We’d need cables and mounts for all three cameras.         To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Hi Ash,   I should be able to give you a few prices for lenses in a couple of days.   Let me do the following: I’ll separate out the quote for the lenses and send you the quote for the rest. Then follow up with information about  the lenses when I have it.   PoE: I assume you are talking about Power over Ethernet. That actually does not apply to the cameras, as they are not Ethernet cameras. However,  the cameras are powered over the USB3 connection (or the PCIe connection, depending on which version you use). So there is no need to supply them with power separately. If you use multiple cameras with a switch, you  will need a power supply for the switch,  the built-in power from the PCIe subsystem or USB3 subsystem is normally not sufficient to support multiple cameras. For USB3 the maximum power that can be drawn through the cable is 5W, and some cameras get close to that, so that multiple cameras would exceed  that.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517        Thanks Mike. That’d work.        For the color camera, we sourced lens from the partner you’d introduced. If you can provide us quote for the lens we used with the monochrome camera for the conveyer belt use case, we can procure color camera lens directly  from your partner as we did in the past for other use cases.       Additionally, is there a PoE version of these cameras for production deployment?         To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Of course. I am trying to get some prices for lenses. You have lenses that are wither not designed for the 12 MPix  cameras, or that are very expensive. I am currently talking to our vendors to see what we can do about  that. If you prefer, I can quote the lenses that we sent you. Should I do that?      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Hello Mike,   Just following up on this. Do let me know how we should go about closing.

I can set that up, but I want to make sure I quote the right products.   You mention 2 color and 1 monochrome camera. Based on the loan documents, that could be either a 5 MPix camera (MC050xG-SY-UB) or a 12 MPix camera (MC124xG-SY-UB). Which camera(s) are you referring to? Lenses: we loaned you a 16mm lens and a 35mm lens (I believe). Which of the lenses would you need? Are substitutes allowed (the 35mm lens is very expensive…) Do you also want me to quote cables (USB3 and Sync cables) and mounting brackets?   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517        Mike,       We need two monochrome cameras with lenses, and a color camera (same configurations you’d provided as a loaner earlier).

We are running against a tight timeline, and since we are not  sure about the right fit, it would be good to test both the camera systems at once. We can return one of these immediately after our tests which shouldn’t take longer than a few days. Additionally, may I request to ship the camera and lens as soon as possible  while we wait for the inputs on strobe light from Mike?   Thanks.      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hi Vivek, the 16mm lens I have will not cover the 12 Mpixel sensor very well. The lens is designed for a 2/3” sensor, and the 12 Mpixel sensor is 1.1”, so coverage at the edges will not be good. But, it would  be adequate if you made a ROI for the center 5 Mpixels. I do have one lens that will cover the entire 12 Mpixel sensor, but it is a 35mm lens and may be the wrong focal length for you. Let me know what you think of all this and if one configuration or the  other sounds better. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the prompt response. This is the last piece of puzzle we need to solve before we can present the solution out in front of the customer. To close this quickly and move to the production phase with  them, time is of essence and as such anything you could do to expedite the lighting setup would go a long way.   Kevin,   We want to try out the model “MC124MG-SY-UB” with a 16mm lens as you have suggested given the availability conditions. I am assuming the dark edges you are talking about will not cover more than 5% of the edges.  Please let me know if this is not the case. Additionally, a 3m USB cable to go with it would be perfect. Would we need a power adapter too?   Ash will be sending out the address and the card information for processing shortly.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   Sure Mike, that would be great.

If mono, I have only a MC124MG-SY-UB camera available at the moment. You can make the ROI smaller to simulate the 5 Mpixel version as  otherwise these cameras are identical (same pixel size and operation). I have a 16mm lens that will cover the area the 5 Mpixel version would need, but it does not completely cover all 12 Mpixels, so you will see some dark edges when imaging with the whole  focal plane. If you want a color camera, I do have the 5 Mpixel version. Let me know what other accessories you’d like with the loan (a 3m USB cable is typical). I will need your complete contact information in including ship to address and phone number as  well I’ll need a credit card to back the loan. Please fill out the attached form with your credit card information. Once completed, please send it via the Dropbox link below.

If you could provide us with a date, we could work towards it.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Hi Vivek, I do have a 16mm lens that should cover our MC050MG camera. I’ll work with you to put a loan together when ready. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed insights. This sounds exciting.   Please find my answers inline in BLUE.     Kevin,   Nice to meet you. Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths for the distance  you gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if the bar code algorithm  can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens. Please let me know if you require any additional details.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Thank you, Mike. We'll confirm the FOV by early tomorrow.          To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    (+ Kevin)   Hi Ash,   I am adding Kevin to the thread, as he is managing our camera loan program. I have to check what we can do about the strobe light.  We don’t typically sell those, so we don’t have them as loan items either. But I will check and let you know.   The items you would need for your test are:   MC023MG-SY-UB (this is a monochrome camera) We can add a zoom lens, but I need to know what the desired field of view is (i.e., the area that you can guarantee contains the  bar code). The focal length of the lens will depend on that size. A mounting bracket and a USB3 cable is not an issue. We should also have a trigger cable that you can use.   For the strobe light I have to wait until I hear back from the company that we end up getting them from.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Good morning and hope you had a great weekend.    Can you please send us the following camera, strobe, and associated peripherals for development / trial? If this works, this would convert into a 200+ camera deal to begin with and our footprint is massive  on the current account, and growing heavily across the industry on a number of use case.     Camera Model: MC023MG-SY-UB with proper Zoom lens that can allow us to focus on moving carton on conveyer from a distance of about 36 to 48 inches Associated Strobe light that can be simultaneously triggered (either through Ximea or your partner) Proper camera mount that we can use  Associated peripherals   Below is the shipping address:   Ashutosh Prasad AMLI QUADRANGLE  2717 Howell St  APT #4114 DALLAS, TEXAS 75204    Additionally, we would also like to understand a bit more about the Xray and Hyperspectral cameras Ximea offers.   Please let me know in case of any questions.    @Hemdeep  Ray – Can you please send Mike our MNDA for signature? It would be good to have a MNDA in place as we jointly target large deals.   --  Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   We don’t make GigE cameras, as most of our customers must rely on getting images as fast as possible, and Ethernet networks can be clogged by other applications.    Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed overview. What you have articulated below looks great to me. We will do an internal review and revert with questions if any.   For the current use case, we have the option to connect the camera either over USB or Ethernet. Do you also have cameras that relay videos over LAN instead of USB?      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517  Absolutely Mike, thanks a ton for this. I am also marking the rest of the team on this email so nobody misses anything.   Hi Ash, Vivek – Mike has provided some rough calculations based on the info we provided. Request you to take a look.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which  of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use  a lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s)  with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when  the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to  see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx.  1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box.  You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400  x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000  x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will  need multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel  (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.   Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Nano_Benchmarks     Loan cameras:   We do have some of these cameras available as loan cameras, but my colleague Kevin is managing the loan program. I will get him  involved if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges  on the card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson  (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can  also discuss that, if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

Just following up on this.  Would be great if you could send us the quote based on the information above.   We can then proceed with the next steps.       Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,       Correction. We’re using color camera with the 16mm lens currently, and need to secure 12mm lens as a loaner from your partner.         To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         Thanks Mike. To summarize, here’s our current configuration:      Monochrome camera is being used with 35mm lens. We’d like to source both camera and lens (2 units each) from you. Color camera is being used with 12mm lens currently, but we’d like to also try the 16mm lens and observe which one’s better. We’d like to source the color camera from you and can work with the lens partner for a 16mm lens loaner  for our testing (they loaned us the 12mm lens while we’re establishing a reseller relationship).  We’d need cables and mounts for all three cameras.         To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Hi Ash,   I should be able to give you a few prices for lenses in a couple of days.   Let me do the following: I’ll separate out the quote for the lenses and send you the quote for the rest. Then follow up with information about  the lenses when I have it.   PoE: I assume you are talking about Power over Ethernet. That actually does not apply to the cameras, as they are not Ethernet cameras. However,  the cameras are powered over the USB3 connection (or the PCIe connection, depending on which version you use). So there is no need to supply them with power separately. If you use multiple cameras with a switch, you  will need a power supply for the switch,  the built-in power from the PCIe subsystem or USB3 subsystem is normally not sufficient to support multiple cameras. For USB3 the maximum power that can be drawn through the cable is 5W, and some cameras get close to that, so that multiple cameras would exceed  that.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517        Thanks Mike. That’d work.        For the color camera, we sourced lens from the partner you’d introduced. If you can provide us quote for the lens we used with the monochrome camera for the conveyer belt  use case, we can procure color camera lens directly from your partner as we did in the past for other use cases.       Additionally, is there a PoE version of these cameras for production deployment?         To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Of course. I am trying to get some prices for lenses. You have lenses that are wither not designed for the 12 MPix  cameras, or that are very expensive. I am currently talking  to our vendors to see what we can do about that. If you prefer, I can quote the lenses that we sent you. Should I do that?      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Hello Mike,   Just following up on this. Do let me know how we should go about closing.

I can set that up, but I want to make sure I quote the  right products.   You mention 2 color and 1 monochrome camera. Based on the loan documents, that could be either a 5 MPix camera (MC050xG-SY-UB) or a 12 MPix camera (MC124xG-SY-UB). Which  camera(s) are you referring to? Lenses: we loaned you a 16mm lens and a 35mm lens (I believe). Which of the lenses would you need?

We are running against a tight timeline, and since we are not sure about  the right fit, it would be good to test both the camera systems at once. We can return one of these immediately after our tests which shouldn’t take longer than a few days. Additionally, may I request to ship the camera and lens as soon as possible while we  wait for the inputs on strobe light from Mike?   Thanks.      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hi Vivek, the 16mm lens I have will not cover the 12 Mpixel sensor very well. The lens is designed for a 2/3” sensor, and the 12 Mpixel sensor is 1.1”, so coverage  at the edges will not be good. But, it would be adequate if you made a ROI for the center 5 Mpixels. I do have one lens that will cover the entire 12 Mpixel sensor, but it is a 35mm lens and may be the wrong focal length for you. Let me know what you think  of all this and if one configuration or the other sounds better. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the prompt response. This is the last piece of puzzle we need to solve before we can present the solution out in front of the customer. To close this  quickly and move to the production phase with them, time is of essence and as such anything you could do to expedite the lighting setup would go a long way.   Kevin,   We want to try out the model “MC124MG-SY-UB” with a 16mm lens as you have suggested given the availability conditions. I am assuming the dark edges you are talking  about will not cover more than 5% of the edges. Please let me know if this is not the case. Additionally, a 3m USB cable to go with it would be perfect. Would we need a power adapter too?   Ash will be sending out the address and the card information for processing shortly.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   Sure Mike, that would be great.

If mono, I have only a MC124MG-SY-UB camera available at the moment. You can make the ROI  smaller to simulate the 5 Mpixel version as otherwise these cameras are identical (same pixel size and operation). I have a 16mm lens that will cover the area the 5 Mpixel version would need, but it does not completely cover all 12 Mpixels, so you will see  some dark edges when imaging with the whole focal plane. If you want a color camera, I do have the 5 Mpixel version. Let me know what other accessories you’d like with the loan (a 3m USB cable is typical). I will need your complete contact information in including  ship to address and phone number as well I’ll need a credit card to back the loan. Please fill out the attached form with your credit card information. Once completed, please send it via the Dropbox link below.

If you could provide us with a date, we could work towards it.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Hi Vivek, I do have a 16mm lens that should cover our MC050MG camera. I’ll work with you to put a loan together when ready. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed insights. This sounds exciting.   Please find my answers inline in BLUE.     Kevin,   Nice to meet you. Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box  (middle of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you  a range of focal lengths for the distance you gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction  of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think  we can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens. Please let me know if you require any additional details.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Thank you, Mike. We'll confirm the FOV by early tomorrow.          To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    (+ Kevin)   Hi Ash,   I am adding Kevin to the thread, as he is managing our camera loan program. I have to check what we can do about the strobe light.  We don’t typically sell those, so we don’t have them as loan items either. But I will check and let you know.   The items you would need for your test are:   MC023MG-SY-UB (this is a monochrome camera) We can add a zoom lens, but I need to know what the desired field of view is (i.e., the area that you can guarantee contains the  bar code). The focal length of the lens will depend on that size. A mounting bracket and a USB3 cable is not an issue. We should also have a trigger cable that you can use.   For the strobe light I have to wait until I hear back from the company that we end up getting them from.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Good morning and hope you had a great weekend.    Can you please send us the following camera, strobe, and associated peripherals for development / trial? If this works, this would convert into a 200+ camera  deal to begin with and our footprint is massive on the current account, and growing heavily across the industry on a number of use case.     Camera Model: MC023MG-SY-UB with proper Zoom lens that can allow us to focus on moving carton on conveyer from a distance of about 36 to 48 inches Associated Strobe light that can be simultaneously triggered (either through Ximea or your partner) Proper camera mount that we can use   Associated peripherals   Below is the shipping address:   Ashutosh Prasad AMLI QUADRANGLE  2717 Howell St  APT #4114 DALLAS, TEXAS 75204    Additionally, we would also like to understand a bit more about the Xray and Hyperspectral cameras Ximea offers.   Please let me know in case of any questions.    @Hemdeep Ray  – Can you please send Mike our MNDA for signature? It would be good to have a MNDA in place as we jointly target large deals.   --  Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   We don’t make GigE cameras, as most of our customers must rely on getting images as fast as possible, and Ethernet networks can be clogged by other applications.    Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed overview. What you have articulated below looks great to me. We will do an internal review and revert with questions if any.   For the current use case, we have the option to connect the camera either over USB or Ethernet. Do you also have cameras that relay videos over LAN instead of  USB?      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517  Absolutely Mike, thanks a ton for this. I am also marking the rest of the team on this email so nobody misses anything.   Hi Ash, Vivek – Mike has provided some rough calculations based on the info we provided. Request you to take a look.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which  of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a  lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s)  with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when  the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to  see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx.  1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box.  You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400  x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000  x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need  multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel  (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.   Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Nano_Benchmarks     Loan cameras:   We do have some of these cameras available as loan cameras, but my colleague Kevin is managing the loan program. I will get him involved  if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the  card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson  (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can  also discuss that, if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

Then follow up with information  about the lenses when I have it.   PoE: I assume you are talking about Power over Ethernet. That actually does not apply to the cameras, as they are not Ethernet cameras.  However, the cameras are powered over the USB3 connection (or the PCIe connection, depending on which version you use). So there is no need to supply them with power separately. If you use multiple cameras with a switch, you  will need a power supply for the  switch, the built-in power from the PCIe subsystem or USB3 subsystem is normally not sufficient to support multiple cameras. For USB3 the maximum power that can be drawn through the cable is 5W, and some cameras get close to that, so that multiple cameras  would exceed that.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517        Thanks Mike. That’d work.        For the color camera, we sourced lens from the partner you’d introduced. If you can provide us quote for the lens we used with the monochrome camera for the conveyer belt use case, we can procure color camera lens  directly from your partner as we did in the past for other use cases.       Additionally, is there a PoE version of these cameras for production deployment?         To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517          [EXTERNAL]    Of course.

We are running against a tight timeline, and since we are  not sure about the right fit, it would be good to test both the camera systems at once. We can return one of these immediately after our tests which shouldn’t take longer than a few days. Additionally, may I request to ship the camera and lens as soon as possible  while we wait for the inputs on strobe light from Mike?   Thanks.      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hi Vivek, the 16mm lens I have will not cover the 12 Mpixel sensor very well. The lens is designed for a 2/3” sensor, and the 12 Mpixel sensor is 1.1”, so coverage at the edges will not be good. But, it  would be adequate if you made a ROI for the center 5 Mpixels. I do have one lens that will cover the entire 12 Mpixel sensor, but it is a 35mm lens and may be the wrong focal length for you. Let me know what you think of all this and if one configuration or  the other sounds better. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the prompt response. This is the last piece of puzzle we need to solve before we can present the solution out in front of the customer. To close this quickly and move to the production phase  with them, time is of essence and as such anything you could do to expedite the lighting setup would go a long way.   Kevin,   We want to try out the model “MC124MG-SY-UB” with a 16mm lens as you have suggested given the availability conditions. I am assuming the dark edges you are talking about will not cover more than 5% of the  edges. Please let me know if this is not the case. Additionally, a 3m USB cable to go with it would be perfect. Would we need a power adapter too?   Ash will be sending out the address and the card information for processing shortly.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   Sure Mike, that would be great.

If mono, I have only a MC124MG-SY-UB camera available at the moment. You can make the ROI smaller to simulate the 5 Mpixel version  as otherwise these cameras are identical (same pixel size and operation). I have a 16mm lens that will cover the area the 5 Mpixel version would need, but it does not completely cover all 12 Mpixels, so you will see some dark edges when imaging with the whole  focal plane. If you want a color camera, I do have the 5 Mpixel version. Let me know what other accessories you’d like with the loan (a 3m USB cable is typical). I will need your complete contact information in including ship to address and phone number as  well I’ll need a credit card to back the loan.

If you could provide us with a date, we could work towards it.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517          [EXTERNAL]    Hi Vivek, I do have a 16mm lens that should cover our MC050MG camera. I’ll work with you to put a loan together when ready. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed insights. This sounds exciting.   Please find my answers inline in BLUE.     Kevin,   Nice to meet you. Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths for the distance  you gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if the bar code algorithm  can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens. Please let me know if you require any additional details.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Thank you, Mike. We'll confirm the FOV by early tomorrow.          To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517          [EXTERNAL]    (+ Kevin)   Hi Ash,   I am adding Kevin to the thread, as he is managing our camera loan program. I have to check what we can do about the strobe  light. We don’t typically sell those, so we don’t have them as loan items either. But I will check and let you know.   The items you would need for your test are:   MC023MG-SY-UB (this is a monochrome camera) We can add a zoom lens, but I need to know what the desired field of view is (i.e., the area that you can guarantee contains  the bar code). The focal length of the lens will depend on that size. A mounting bracket and a USB3 cable is not an issue. We should also have a trigger cable that you can use.   For the strobe light I have to wait until I hear back from the company that we end up getting them from.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Good morning and hope you had a great weekend.    Can you please send us the following camera, strobe, and associated peripherals for development / trial?

It would be good to have a MNDA in place as we jointly target large deals.   --  Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   We don’t make GigE cameras, as most of our customers must rely on getting images as fast as possible, and Ethernet networks can be clogged by other applications.    Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed overview. What you have articulated below looks great to me. We will do an internal review and revert with questions if any.   For the current use case, we have the option to connect the camera either over USB or Ethernet. Do you also have cameras that relay videos over LAN instead of USB?      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517  Absolutely Mike, thanks a ton for this. I am also marking the rest of the team on this email so nobody misses anything.   Hi Ash, Vivek – Mike has provided some rough calculations based on the info we provided. Request you to take a look.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see  which of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and  use a lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar  codes(s) with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt,  and when the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple  voltage pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light  to see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code  is approx. 1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area  of the box. You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly  2,400 x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like  4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you  will need multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the  12 Mpixel (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.   Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Nano_Benchmarks     Loan cameras:   We do have some of these cameras available as loan cameras, but my colleague Kevin is managing the loan program. I will get  him involved if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no  charges on the card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the  Jetson (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson.  We can also discuss that, if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

"Hello Mike,   Hope you are doing well!  Would be great if you could send us the quote based on the information provided earlier.   We can then proceed with the next steps             Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517       Hello Mike,   Hope you had a relaxing weekend. Just following up on this.  Would be great if you could send us the quote based on the information above.   We can then proceed with the next steps.       Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,       Correction. We’re using color camera with the 16mm lens currently, and need to secure 12mm lens as a loaner from your partner.         To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         Thanks Mike. To summarize, here’s our current configuration:     Monochrome camera is being used with 35mm lens. We’d like to source both camera and lens (2 units each) from you.Color camera is being used with 12mm lens currently, but we’d like to also try the 16mm lens and observe which one’s better. We’d like to source the color camera from  you and can work with the lens partner for a 16mm lens loaner for our testing (they loaned us the 12mm lens while we’re establishing a reseller relationship).  We’d need cables and mounts for all three cameras.         To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Hi Ash,   I should be able to give you a few prices for lenses in a couple of days.   Let me do the following: I’ll separate out the quote for the lenses and send you the quote for the rest. Then follow up with  information about the lenses when I have it.   PoE: I assume you are talking about Power over Ethernet. That actually does not apply to the cameras, as they are not Ethernet  cameras. However, the cameras are powered over the USB3 connection (or the PCIe connection, depending on which version you use). So there is no need to supply them with power separately. If you use multiple cameras with a switch, you  will need a power supply  for the switch, the built-in power from the PCIe subsystem or USB3 subsystem is normally not sufficient to support multiple cameras. For USB3 the maximum power that can be drawn through the cable is 5W, and some cameras get close to that, so that multiple  cameras would exceed that.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517        Thanks Mike. That’d work.        For the color camera, we sourced lens from the partner you’d introduced. If you can provide us quote for the lens we used with the monochrome camera for the conveyer belt use case, we can procure  color camera lens directly from your partner as we did in the past for other use cases.       Additionally, is there a PoE version of these cameras for production deployment?         To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Of course. I am trying to get some prices for lenses. You have lenses that are wither not designed for the 12 MPix  cameras, or that are very expensive. I am currently talking to our vendors to  see what we can do about that. If you prefer, I can quote the lenses that we sent you. Should I do that?      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Hello Mike,   Just following up on this. Do let me know how we should go about closing.

I can set that up, but I want to make sure I quote the right products.   You mention 2 color and 1 monochrome camera. Based on the loan documents, that could be either a 5 MPix camera (MC050xG-SY-UB) or a 12 MPix camera (MC124xG-SY-UB). Which camera(s) are you referring  to? Lenses: we loaned you a 16mm lens and a 35mm lens (I believe). Which of the lenses would you need? Are substitutes allowed (the 35mm lens is very expensive…) Do you also want me to quote cables (USB3 and Sync cables) and mounting brackets?   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517        Mike,       We need two monochrome cameras with lenses, and a color camera (same configurations you’d provided as a loaner earlier).

We are running against a tight timeline, and  since we are not sure about the right fit, it would be good to test both the camera systems at once. We can return one of these immediately after our tests which shouldn’t take longer than a few days. Additionally, may I request to ship the camera and lens  as soon as possible while we wait for the inputs on strobe light from Mike?   Thanks.      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hi Vivek, the 16mm lens I have will not cover the 12 Mpixel sensor very well. The lens is designed for a 2/3” sensor, and the 12 Mpixel sensor is 1.1”, so coverage at the edges will not  be good. But, it would be adequate if you made a ROI for the center 5 Mpixels. I do have one lens that will cover the entire 12 Mpixel sensor, but it is a 35mm lens and may be the wrong focal length for you. Let me know what you think of all this and if one  configuration or the other sounds better. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the prompt response. This is the last piece of puzzle we need to solve before we can present the solution out in front of the customer. To close this quickly and move to the  production phase with them, time is of essence and as such anything you could do to expedite the lighting setup would go a long way.   Kevin,   We want to try out the model “MC124MG-SY-UB” with a 16mm lens as you have suggested given the availability conditions. I am assuming the dark edges you are talking about will not cover  more than 5% of the edges. Please let me know if this is not the case. Additionally, a 3m USB cable to go with it would be perfect. Would we need a power adapter too?   Ash will be sending out the address and the card information for processing shortly.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   Sure Mike, that would be great.

If mono, I have only a MC124MG-SY-UB camera available at the moment. You can make the ROI smaller to simulate the  5 Mpixel version as otherwise these cameras are identical (same pixel size and operation). I have a 16mm lens that will cover the area the 5 Mpixel version would need, but it does not completely cover all 12 Mpixels, so you will see some dark edges when imaging  with the whole focal plane. If you want a color camera, I do have the 5 Mpixel version. Let me know what other accessories you’d like with the loan (a 3m USB cable is typical). I will need your complete contact information in including ship to address and  phone number as well I’ll need a credit card to back the loan. Please fill out the attached form with your credit card information. Once completed, please send it via the Dropbox link below.

If you could provide us with a date, we could work towards it.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Hi Vivek, I do have a 16mm lens that should cover our MC050MG camera. I’ll work with you to put a loan together when ready. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed insights. This sounds exciting.   Please find my answers inline in BLUE.     Kevin,   Nice to meet you. Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of the range you  gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths  for the distance you gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if  the bar code algorithm can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner package  together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens. Please let me know if you require any additional details.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Thank you, Mike. We'll confirm the FOV by early tomorrow.          To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --     Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    (+ Kevin)   Hi Ash,   I am adding Kevin to the thread, as he is managing our camera loan program. I have to check what we can do about  the strobe light. We don’t typically sell those, so we don’t have them as loan items either. But I will check and let you know.   The items you would need for your test are:   MC023MG-SY-UB (this is a monochrome camera) We can add a zoom lens, but I need to know what the desired field of view is (i.e., the area that you can guarantee  contains the bar code). The focal length of the lens will depend on that size. A mounting bracket and a USB3 cable is not an issue. We should also have a trigger cable that you can use.   For the strobe light I have to wait until I hear back from the company that we end up getting them from.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Good morning and hope you had a great weekend.    Can you please send us the following camera, strobe, and associated peripherals for development / trial? If this works, this would convert into a 200+ camera deal to begin with and  our footprint is massive on the current account, and growing heavily across the industry on a number of use case.     Camera Model: MC023MG-SY-UB with proper Zoom lens that can allow us to focus on moving carton on conveyer from a distance of about 36 to 48 inches Associated Strobe light that can be simultaneously triggered (either through Ximea or your partner) Proper camera mount that we can use  Associated peripherals   Below is the shipping address:   Ashutosh Prasad AMLI QUADRANGLE  2717 Howell St  APT #4114 DALLAS, TEXAS 75204    Additionally, we would also like to understand a bit more about the Xray and Hyperspectral cameras Ximea offers.   Please let me know in case of any questions.    @Hemdeep  Ray – Can you please send Mike our MNDA for signature?

Do you also have cameras that relay videos over LAN instead of USB?      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517  Absolutely Mike, thanks a ton for this. I am also marking the rest of the team on this email so nobody misses anything.   Hi Ash, Vivek – Mike has provided some rough calculations based on the info we provided. Request you to take a look.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank  you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting  and see which of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get  very hot, and use a lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate  the bar codes(s) with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.     I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across  the belt, and when the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond  to a simple voltage pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on  the strobe light to see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The  bar code is approx. 1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3  feet area of the box. You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution  of roughly 2,400 x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something  like 4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that  means you will need multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that  even the 12 Mpixel (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.   Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Nano_Benchmarks     Loan cameras:   We do have some of these cameras available as loan cameras, but my colleague Kevin is managing the loan program.  I will get him involved if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there  will be no charges on the card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better  to put the Jetson (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for  the Jetson. We can also discuss that, if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

"Hello Mike,   Hope you had a relaxing weekend. Just following up on this.  Would be great if you could send us the quote based on the information above.   We can then proceed with the next steps.       Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,       Correction. We’re using color camera with the 16mm lens currently, and need to secure 12mm lens as a loaner from your partner.         To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         Thanks Mike. To summarize, here’s our current configuration:      Monochrome camera is being used with 35mm lens. We’d like to source both camera and lens (2 units each) from you. Color camera is being used with 12mm lens currently, but we’d like to also try the 16mm lens and observe which one’s better. We’d like to source the color camera from you and can work with the lens partner for a 16mm lens loaner  for our testing (they loaned us the 12mm lens while we’re establishing a reseller relationship).  We’d need cables and mounts for all three cameras.         To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Hi Ash,   I should be able to give you a few prices for lenses in a couple of days.   Let me do the following: I’ll separate out the quote for the lenses and send you the quote for the rest. Then follow up with information  about the lenses when I have it.   PoE: I assume you are talking about Power over Ethernet. That actually does not apply to the cameras, as they are not Ethernet  cameras. However, the cameras are powered over the USB3 connection (or the PCIe connection, depending on which version you use). So there is no need to supply them with power separately. If you use multiple cameras with a switch, you  will need a power supply  for the switch, the built-in power from the PCIe subsystem or USB3 subsystem is normally not sufficient to support multiple cameras. For USB3 the maximum power that can be drawn through the cable is 5W, and some cameras get close to that, so that multiple  cameras would exceed that.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517        Thanks Mike. That’d work.        For the color camera, we sourced lens from the partner you’d introduced. If you can provide us quote for the lens we used with the monochrome camera for the conveyer belt use case, we can procure color  camera lens directly from your partner as we did in the past for other use cases.       Additionally, is there a PoE version of these cameras for production deployment?         To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Of course. I am trying to get some prices for lenses. You have lenses that are wither not designed for the 12 MPix  cameras, or that are very expensive. I am currently talking to our vendors to see  what we can do about that. If you prefer, I can quote the lenses that we sent you. Should I do that?      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Hello Mike,   Just following up on this. Do let me know how we should go about closing.

I can set that up, but I want to make sure I quote the right products.   You mention 2 color and 1 monochrome camera. Based on the loan documents, that could be either a 5 MPix camera (MC050xG-SY-UB) or a 12 MPix camera (MC124xG-SY-UB). Which camera(s) are you referring  to? Lenses: we loaned you a 16mm lens and a 35mm lens (I believe). Which of the lenses would you need? Are substitutes allowed (the 35mm lens is very expensive…) Do you also want me to quote cables (USB3 and Sync cables) and mounting brackets?   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517        Mike,       We need two monochrome cameras with lenses, and a color camera (same configurations you’d provided as a loaner earlier).

We are running against a tight timeline, and since  we are not sure about the right fit, it would be good to test both the camera systems at once. We can return one of these immediately after our tests which shouldn’t take longer than a few days. Additionally, may I request to ship the camera and lens as soon  as possible while we wait for the inputs on strobe light from Mike?   Thanks.      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hi Vivek, the 16mm lens I have will not cover the 12 Mpixel sensor very well. The lens is designed for a 2/3” sensor, and the 12 Mpixel sensor is 1.1”, so coverage at the edges will not be  good. But, it would be adequate if you made a ROI for the center 5 Mpixels. I do have one lens that will cover the entire 12 Mpixel sensor, but it is a 35mm lens and may be the wrong focal length for you. Let me know what you think of all this and if one configuration  or the other sounds better. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the prompt response. This is the last piece of puzzle we need to solve before we can present the solution out in front of the customer. To close this quickly and move to the  production phase with them, time is of essence and as such anything you could do to expedite the lighting setup would go a long way.   Kevin,   We want to try out the model “MC124MG-SY-UB” with a 16mm lens as you have suggested given the availability conditions. I am assuming the dark edges you are talking about will not cover more  than 5% of the edges. Please let me know if this is not the case. Additionally, a 3m USB cable to go with it would be perfect. Would we need a power adapter too?   Ash will be sending out the address and the card information for processing shortly.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   Sure Mike, that would be great.

Meanwhile, @Vivek Prasadwill  provid3 you with the other pieces of information       Best,   Hemdeep       Get  Outlook for Android       Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         Hi Kevin,       @Ashutosh Prasad  has his boots on the ground so either him or @Vivek Prasad will  respond to your query soon.       Best,   Hemdeep       Get  Outlook for Android          RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     [EXTERNAL]    Hi Aman, do you want a monochrome camera or color? If mono, I have only a MC124MG-SY-UB camera available at the moment. You can make the ROI smaller to simulate the  5 Mpixel version as otherwise these cameras are identical (same pixel size and operation). I have a 16mm lens that will cover the area the 5 Mpixel version would need, but it does not completely cover all 12 Mpixels, so you will see some dark edges when imaging  with the whole focal plane. If you want a color camera, I do have the 5 Mpixel version. Let me know what other accessories you’d like with the loan (a 3m USB cable is typical). I will need your complete contact information in including ship to address and  phone number as well I’ll need a credit card to back the loan. Please fill out the attached form with your credit card information. Once completed, please send it via the Dropbox link below. You may call me at 303-389-9838 x210 if  you prefer.   https://www.dropbox.com/request/rWULiT1x0jP2bZCElJwI    Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517      Hi Kevin,   Do let us know when the loan camera with the lens will be ready for delivery. If you could provide us with a date, we could work towards it.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Hi Vivek, I do have a 16mm lens that should cover our MC050MG camera. I’ll work with you to put a loan together when ready. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed insights. This sounds exciting.   Please find my answers inline in BLUE.     Kevin,   Nice to meet you. Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of the range you  gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths  for the distance you gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if the  bar code algorithm can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner package  together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens. Please let me know if you require any additional details.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Thank you, Mike. We'll confirm the FOV by early tomorrow.          To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --     Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    (+ Kevin)   Hi Ash,   I am adding Kevin to the thread, as he is managing our camera loan program. I have to check what we can do about  the strobe light. We don’t typically sell those, so we don’t have them as loan items either. But I will check and let you know.   The items you would need for your test are:   MC023MG-SY-UB (this is a monochrome camera) We can add a zoom lens, but I need to know what the desired field of view is (i.e., the area that you can guarantee  contains the bar code). The focal length of the lens will depend on that size. A mounting bracket and a USB3 cable is not an issue. We should also have a trigger cable that you can use.   For the strobe light I have to wait until I hear back from the company that we end up getting them from.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Good morning and hope you had a great weekend.    Can you please send us the following camera, strobe, and associated peripherals for development / trial? If this works, this would convert into a 200+ camera deal to begin with and our  footprint is massive on the current account, and growing heavily across the industry on a number of use case.     Camera Model: MC023MG-SY-UB with proper Zoom lens that can allow us to focus on moving carton on conveyer from a distance of about 36 to 48 inches Associated Strobe light that can be simultaneously triggered (either through Ximea or your partner) Proper camera mount that we can use  Associated peripherals   Below is the shipping address:   Ashutosh Prasad AMLI QUADRANGLE  2717 Howell St  APT #4114 DALLAS, TEXAS 75204    Additionally, we would also like to understand a bit more about the Xray and Hyperspectral cameras Ximea offers.   Please let me know in case of any questions.    @Hemdeep  Ray – Can you please send Mike our MNDA for signature? It would be good to have a MNDA in place as we jointly target large deals.   --  Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   We don’t make GigE cameras, as most of our customers must rely on getting images as fast as possible, and Ethernet networks can be clogged by other applications.    Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed overview. What you have articulated below looks great to me. We will do an internal review and revert with questions if any.   For the current use case, we have the option to connect the camera either over USB or Ethernet. Do you also have cameras that relay videos over LAN instead of USB?      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517  Absolutely Mike, thanks a ton for this. I am also marking the rest of the team on this email so nobody misses anything.   Hi Ash, Vivek – Mike has provided some rough calculations based on the info we provided. Request you to take a look.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting  and see which of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very  hot, and use a lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate  the bar codes(s) with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.     I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the  belt, and when the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a  simple voltage pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe  light to see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar  code is approx. 1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet  area of the box. You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of  roughly 2,400 x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something  like 4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means  you will need multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even  the 12 Mpixel (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.   Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Nano_Benchmarks     Loan cameras:   We do have some of these cameras available as loan cameras, but my colleague Kevin is managing the loan program.  I will get him involved if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there  will be no charges on the card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to  put the Jetson (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the  Jetson. We can also discuss that, if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

"Mike,   Correction. We’re using color camera with the 16mm lens currently, and need to secure 12mm lens as a loaner from your partner.      To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/   --  Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517      Thanks Mike. To summarize, here’s our current configuration:    Monochrome camera is being used with 35mm lens. We’d like to source both camera and lens (2 units each) from you.Color camera is being used with 12mm lens currently, but we’d like to also try the 16mm lens and observe which one’s better. We’d like to source the color camera from you and can work with the lens partner for a 16mm lens loaner for our testing (they  loaned us the 12mm lens while we’re establishing a reseller relationship).

To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/   --  Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     [EXTERNAL]    Hi Ash,     I should be able to give you a few prices for lenses in a couple of days.     Let me do the following: I’ll separate out the quote for the lenses and send you the quote for the rest. Then follow up with information about the lenses when I have it.     PoE: I assume you are talking about Power over Ethernet. That actually does not apply to the cameras, as they are not Ethernet cameras. However, the cameras are powered  over the USB3 connection (or the PCIe connection, depending on which version you use). So there is no need to supply them with power separately. If you use multiple cameras with a switch, you  will need a power supply for the switch, the built-in power from  the PCIe subsystem or USB3 subsystem is normally not sufficient to support multiple cameras. For USB3 the maximum power that can be drawn through the cable is 5W, and some cameras get close to that, so that multiple cameras would exceed that.     Mike        Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517          Thanks Mike. That’d work.          For the color camera, we sourced lens from the partner you’d introduced. If you can provide us quote for the lens we used with the monochrome camera for the conveyer belt use case, we can procure color camera lens directly from your partner as we did in the  past for other use cases.         Additionally, is there a PoE version of these cameras for production deployment?           To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/         --     Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517           [EXTERNAL]     Of course.

We are running against a tight timeline, and since we are not sure about the right fit, it would be good to test both the camera systems at once.  We can return one of these immediately after our tests which shouldn’t take longer than a few days. Additionally, may I request to ship the camera and lens as soon as possible while we wait for the inputs on strobe light from Mike?     Thanks.        --  Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517    [EXTERNAL]    Hi Vivek, the 16mm lens I have will not cover the 12 Mpixel sensor very well. The lens is designed for a 2/3” sensor, and the 12 Mpixel sensor is 1.1”, so coverage at the edges will not be good. But, it would be adequate if you  made a ROI for the center 5 Mpixels. I do have one lens that will cover the entire 12 Mpixel sensor, but it is a 35mm lens and may be the wrong focal length for you. Let me know what you think of all this and if one configuration or the other sounds better.  Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517       Mike,     Thank you for the prompt response. This is the last piece of puzzle we need to solve before we can present the solution out in front of the customer. To close this quickly and move to the production phase with them, time is of  essence and as such anything you could do to expedite the lighting setup would go a long way.     Kevin,     We want to try out the model “MC124MG-SY-UB” with a 16mm lens as you have suggested given the availability conditions. I am assuming the dark edges you are talking about will not cover more than 5% of the edges. Please let me  know if this is not the case. Additionally, a 3m USB cable to go with it would be perfect. Would we need a power adapter too?     Ash will be sending out the address and the card information for processing shortly.        --  Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517    Sure Mike, that would be great.

If mono, I have only a MC124MG-SY-UB camera available at the moment. You can make the ROI smaller to simulate the 5 Mpixel version as otherwise these cameras are identical (same  pixel size and operation). I have a 16mm lens that will cover the area the 5 Mpixel version would need, but it does not completely cover all 12 Mpixels, so you will see some dark edges when imaging with the whole focal plane. If you want a color camera, I  do have the 5 Mpixel version. Let me know what other accessories you’d like with the loan (a 3m USB cable is typical). I will need your complete contact information in including ship to address and phone number as well I’ll need a credit card to back the loan. Please fill out the attached form with your credit card information. Once completed, please send it via the Dropbox link below.

If you could provide us with a date, we could work towards it.       Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517           [EXTERNAL]     Hi Vivek, I do have a 16mm lens that should cover our MC050MG camera. I’ll work with you to put a loan together when ready.  Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517       Mike,     Thank you for the detailed insights. This sounds exciting.     Please find my answers inline in  BLUE.        Kevin,     Nice to meet you. Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?        --  Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517    [EXTERNAL]    Hello Vivek,     I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of the range you gave me).  Makes sense.     Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths for the distance you gave me: at 30” working  distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard.  Thank you.     The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can deal with it. A  correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement.  Our team should be able to take care of this.     I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.     I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:      What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?     So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner package together for you.     Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517       Mike,     We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.     I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens. Please let me know if you require any additional details.        --  Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517      Thank you, Mike. We'll confirm the FOV by early tomorrow.            To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/         --     Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517           [EXTERNAL]     (+ Kevin)     Hi Ash,     I am adding Kevin to the thread, as he is managing our camera loan program. I have to check what we can do about the strobe light. We don’t typically sell those, so we don’t have them as  loan items either. But I will check and let you know.     The items you would need for your test are:     MC023MG-SY-UB (this is a monochrome camera)  We can add a zoom lens, but I need to know what the desired field of view is (i.e., the area that you can guarantee contains the bar code). The focal length of the lens will depend on that  size.  A mounting bracket and a USB3 cable is not an issue. We should also have a trigger cable that you can use.     For the strobe light I have to wait until I hear back from the company that we end up getting them from.     Mike        Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517       Mike,     Good morning and hope you had a great weekend.       Can you please send us the following camera, strobe, and associated peripherals for development / trial? If this works, this would convert into a 200+ camera deal to begin with and our footprint is massive on the current account,  and growing heavily across the industry on a number of use case.      Camera Model: MC023MG-SY-UB with proper Zoom lens that can allow us to focus on moving carton on conveyer from a distance of about 36 to 48 inches Associated Strobe light that can be simultaneously triggered (either through Ximea or your partner) Proper camera mount that we can use  Associated peripherals     Below is the shipping address:     Ashutosh Prasad  AMLI QUADRANGLE   2717 Howell St   APT #4114  DALLAS, TEXAS 75204      Additionally, we would also like to understand a bit more about the Xray and Hyperspectral cameras Ximea offers.     Please let me know in case of any questions.      @Hemdeep Ray  – Can you please send Mike our MNDA for signature? It would be good to have a MNDA in place as we jointly target large deals.     --   Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517    [EXTERNAL]    Hello Vivek,     We don’t make GigE cameras, as most of our customers must rely on getting images as fast as possible, and Ethernet networks can be clogged by other applications.      Mike        Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517       Mike,     Thank you for the detailed overview. What you have articulated below looks great to me. We will do an internal review and revert with questions if any.     For the current use case, we have the option to connect the camera either over USB or Ethernet. Do you also have cameras that relay videos over LAN instead of USB?        --  Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   Absolutely Mike, thanks a ton for this. I am also marking the rest of the team on this email so nobody misses anything.     Hi Ash, Vivek – Mike has provided some rough calculations based on the info we provided. Request you to take a look.        Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517    [EXTERNAL]    Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.     Hello Gentlemen,     Thank you for talking to me yesterday.      I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which of our cameras could get you there.     Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.      In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot  light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.   The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s) with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.      I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that  triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite  simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to see what is needed there.     Geometry:     You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx. 1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture  that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box. You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet  area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).      4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the  side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000 x 2000.     This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.      Frame rate.      The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes  are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation  can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.      So, which camera should you use?     I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.     Using a  Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do have  the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:     TX2 carrier boards:  https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras  API information:   https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support  Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing  TX2 vs Xavier:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier  Nano benchmarks:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Nano_Benchmarks        Loan cameras:     We do have some of these cameras available as loan cameras, but my colleague Kevin is managing the loan program. I will get him involved if you want to try the camera to see if it works.  The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more  complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.     Further thought:     What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a  dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can also discuss that, if you want. We can design such an interface  board to your specifications.     I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.     Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517       Sorry.

"Thanks Mike. To summarize, here’s our current configuration:    Monochrome camera is being used with 35mm lens. We’d like to source both camera and lens (2 units each) from you.Color camera is being used with 12mm lens currently, but we’d like to also try the 16mm lens and observe which one’s better. We’d like to source the color camera from you and can work with the lens partner for a 16mm lens loaner for our testing (they  loaned us the 12mm lens while we’re establishing a reseller relationship).  We’d need cables and mounts for all three cameras.     To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/   --  Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517      [EXTERNAL]   Hi Ash,   I should be able to give you a few prices for lenses in a couple of days.   Let me do the following: I’ll separate out the quote for the lenses and send you the quote for the rest. Then follow up with information about the lenses when  I have it.   PoE: I assume you are talking about Power over Ethernet. That actually does not apply to the cameras, as they are not Ethernet cameras. However, the cameras  are powered over the USB3 connection (or the PCIe connection, depending on which version you use). So there is no need to supply them with power separately. If you use multiple cameras with a switch, you  will need a power supply for the switch, the built-in  power from the PCIe subsystem or USB3 subsystem is normally not sufficient to support multiple cameras. For USB3 the maximum power that can be drawn through the cable is 5W, and some cameras get close to that, so that multiple cameras would exceed that.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517        Thanks Mike. That’d work.        For the color camera, we sourced lens from the partner you’d introduced. If you can provide us quote for the lens we used with the monochrome camera for the conveyer belt use case, we can procure color camera lens directly from your partner  as we did in the past for other use cases.       Additionally, is there a PoE version of these cameras for production deployment?         To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Of course. I am trying to get some prices for lenses. You have lenses that are wither not designed for the 12 MPix  cameras, or that are very expensive. I am currently talking to our vendors to see what  we can do about that. If you prefer, I can quote the lenses that we sent you. Should I do that?      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Hello Mike,   Just following up on this. Do let me know how we should go about closing.

I can set that up, but I want to make sure I quote the right products.   You mention 2 color and 1 monochrome camera. Based on the loan documents, that could be either a 5 MPix camera (MC050xG-SY-UB) or a 12 MPix camera (MC124xG-SY-UB). Which camera(s) are you referring to? Lenses: we loaned you a 16mm lens and a 35mm lens (I believe). Which of the lenses would you need? Are substitutes allowed (the 35mm lens is very expensive…) Do you also want me to quote cables (USB3 and Sync cables) and mounting brackets?   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517        Mike,       We need two monochrome cameras with lenses, and a color camera (same configurations you’d provided as a loaner earlier).

We are running against a tight timeline, and since we are not sure about the right fit, it  would be good to test both the camera systems at once. We can return one of these immediately after our tests which shouldn’t take longer than a few days. Additionally, may I request to ship the camera and lens as soon as possible while we wait for the inputs  on strobe light from Mike?   Thanks.      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hi Vivek, the 16mm lens I have will not cover the 12 Mpixel sensor very well. The lens is designed for a 2/3” sensor, and the 12 Mpixel sensor is 1.1”, so coverage at the edges  will not be good. But, it would be adequate if you made a ROI for the center 5 Mpixels. I do have one lens that will cover the entire 12 Mpixel sensor, but it is a 35mm lens and may be the wrong focal length for you. Let me know what you think of all this  and if one configuration or the other sounds better. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the prompt response. This is the last piece of puzzle we need to solve before we can present the solution out in front of the customer. To close this quickly and  move to the production phase with them, time is of essence and as such anything you could do to expedite the lighting setup would go a long way.   Kevin,   We want to try out the model “MC124MG-SY-UB” with a 16mm lens as you have suggested given the availability conditions. I am assuming the dark edges you are talking about will  not cover more than 5% of the edges. Please let me know if this is not the case. Additionally, a 3m USB cable to go with it would be perfect. Would we need a power adapter too?   Ash will be sending out the address and the card information for processing shortly.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   Sure Mike, that would be great.

If mono, I have only a MC124MG-SY-UB camera available at the moment. You can make the ROI smaller to  simulate the 5 Mpixel version as otherwise these cameras are identical (same pixel size and operation). I have a 16mm lens that will cover the area the 5 Mpixel version would need, but it does not completely cover all 12 Mpixels, so you will see some dark  edges when imaging with the whole focal plane. If you want a color camera, I do have the 5 Mpixel version. Let me know what other accessories you’d like with the loan (a 3m USB cable is typical). I will need your complete contact information in including ship  to address and phone number as well I’ll need a credit card to back the loan.

If you could provide us with a date, we could work towards it.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Hi Vivek, I do have a 16mm lens that should cover our MC050MG camera. I’ll work with you to put a loan together when ready. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed insights. This sounds exciting.   Please find my answers inline in BLUE.     Kevin,   Nice to meet you. Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of  the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of  focal lengths for the distance you gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image,  or if the bar code algorithm can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a  loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens. Please let me know if you require any additional details.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Thank you, Mike. We'll confirm the FOV by early tomorrow.          To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    (+ Kevin)   Hi Ash,   I am adding Kevin to the thread, as he is managing our camera loan program. I have to check what we can do about the strobe light. We don’t typically  sell those, so we don’t have them as loan items either. But I will check and let you know.   The items you would need for your test are:   MC023MG-SY-UB (this is a monochrome camera) We can add a zoom lens, but I need to know what the desired field of view is (i.e., the area that you can guarantee contains the bar code). The  focal length of the lens will depend on that size. A mounting bracket and a USB3 cable is not an issue. We should also have a trigger cable that you can use.   For the strobe light I have to wait until I hear back from the company that we end up getting them from.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Good morning and hope you had a great weekend.    Can you please send us the following camera, strobe, and associated peripherals for development / trial? If this works, this would convert into a 200+ camera deal to begin  with and our footprint is massive on the current account, and growing heavily across the industry on a number of use case.     Camera Model: MC023MG-SY-UB with proper Zoom lens that can allow us to focus on moving carton on conveyer from a distance of about 36 to 48 inches Associated Strobe light that can be simultaneously triggered (either through Ximea or your partner) Proper camera mount that we can use  Associated peripherals   Below is the shipping address:   Ashutosh Prasad AMLI QUADRANGLE  2717 Howell St  APT #4114 DALLAS, TEXAS 75204    Additionally, we would also like to understand a bit more about the Xray and Hyperspectral cameras Ximea offers.   Please let me know in case of any questions.    @Hemdeep Ray  – Can you please send Mike our MNDA for signature? It would be good to have a MNDA in place as we jointly target large deals.   --  Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   We don’t make GigE cameras, as most of our customers must rely on getting images as fast as possible, and Ethernet networks can be clogged by other applications.    Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed overview. What you have articulated below looks great to me. We will do an internal review and revert with questions if any.   For the current use case, we have the option to connect the camera either over USB or Ethernet. Do you also have cameras that relay videos over LAN instead of USB?      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517  Absolutely Mike, thanks a ton for this. I am also marking the rest of the team on this email so nobody misses anything.   Hi Ash, Vivek – Mike has provided some rough calculations based on the info we provided. Request you to take a look.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which of our cameras  could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot or power.  But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s) with a short  enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when the box interrupts  the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse (up to 24V).  So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to see what is needed  there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx. 1.5 inches  wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box. You would  need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x 1,800. The  same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need multiple  images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel (4000 x 3000)  in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.   Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Nano_Benchmarks     Loan cameras:   We do have some of these cameras available as loan cameras, but my colleague Kevin is managing the loan program. I will get him involved if you  want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the card  if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson (if you want  to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can also discuss  that, if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

"Thanks Mike. That’d work.    For the color camera, we sourced lens from the partner you’d introduced. If you can provide us quote for the lens we used with the monochrome camera for the conveyer belt use case, we can procure color camera lens directly from your partner as  we did in the past for other use cases.

We are running against a tight timeline, and since we are not sure about the right fit, it  would be good to test both the camera systems at once. We can return one of these immediately after our tests which shouldn’t take longer than a few days. Additionally, may I request to ship the camera and lens as soon as possible while we wait for the inputs  on strobe light from Mike?   Thanks.      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hi Vivek, the 16mm lens I have will not cover the 12 Mpixel sensor very well. The lens is designed for a 2/3” sensor, and the 12 Mpixel sensor is 1.1”, so coverage at the edges  will not be good. But, it would be adequate if you made a ROI for the center 5 Mpixels. I do have one lens that will cover the entire 12 Mpixel sensor, but it is a 35mm lens and may be the wrong focal length for you. Let me know what you think of all this  and if one configuration or the other sounds better. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the prompt response. This is the last piece of puzzle we need to solve before we can present the solution out in front of the customer. To close this quickly and  move to the production phase with them, time is of essence and as such anything you could do to expedite the lighting setup would go a long way.   Kevin,   We want to try out the model “MC124MG-SY-UB” with a 16mm lens as you have suggested given the availability conditions. I am assuming the dark edges you are talking about will  not cover more than 5% of the edges. Please let me know if this is not the case. Additionally, a 3m USB cable to go with it would be perfect. Would we need a power adapter too?   Ash will be sending out the address and the card information for processing shortly.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   Sure Mike, that would be great.

If mono, I have only a MC124MG-SY-UB camera available at the moment. You can make the ROI smaller to  simulate the 5 Mpixel version as otherwise these cameras are identical (same pixel size and operation). I have a 16mm lens that will cover the area the 5 Mpixel version would need, but it does not completely cover all 12 Mpixels, so you will see some dark  edges when imaging with the whole focal plane. If you want a color camera, I do have the 5 Mpixel version. Let me know what other accessories you’d like with the loan (a 3m USB cable is typical). I will need your complete contact information in including ship  to address and phone number as well I’ll need a credit card to back the loan.

If you could provide us with a date, we could work towards it.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Hi Vivek, I do have a 16mm lens that should cover our MC050MG camera. I’ll work with you to put a loan together when ready. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed insights. This sounds exciting.   Please find my answers inline in BLUE.     Kevin,   Nice to meet you. Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of the  range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of  focal lengths for the distance you gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image,  or if the bar code algorithm can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner  package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens. Please let me know if you require any additional details.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Thank you, Mike. We'll confirm the FOV by early tomorrow.          To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    (+ Kevin)   Hi Ash,   I am adding Kevin to the thread, as he is managing our camera loan program. I have to check what we can do about the strobe light. We don’t typically  sell those, so we don’t have them as loan items either. But I will check and let you know.   The items you would need for your test are:   MC023MG-SY-UB (this is a monochrome camera) We can add a zoom lens, but I need to know what the desired field of view is (i.e., the area that you can guarantee contains the bar code). The  focal length of the lens will depend on that size. A mounting bracket and a USB3 cable is not an issue. We should also have a trigger cable that you can use.   For the strobe light I have to wait until I hear back from the company that we end up getting them from.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Good morning and hope you had a great weekend.    Can you please send us the following camera, strobe, and associated peripherals for development / trial? If this works, this would convert into a 200+ camera deal to begin  with and our footprint is massive on the current account, and growing heavily across the industry on a number of use case.     Camera Model: MC023MG-SY-UB with proper Zoom lens that can allow us to focus on moving carton on conveyer from a distance of about 36 to 48 inches Associated Strobe light that can be simultaneously triggered (either through Ximea or your partner) Proper camera mount that we can use  Associated peripherals   Below is the shipping address:   Ashutosh Prasad AMLI QUADRANGLE  2717 Howell St  APT #4114 DALLAS, TEXAS 75204    Additionally, we would also like to understand a bit more about the Xray and Hyperspectral cameras Ximea offers.   Please let me know in case of any questions.    @Hemdeep Ray  – Can you please send Mike our MNDA for signature? It would be good to have a MNDA in place as we jointly target large deals.   --  Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   We don’t make GigE cameras, as most of our customers must rely on getting images as fast as possible, and Ethernet networks can be clogged by other applications.    Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed overview. What you have articulated below looks great to me. We will do an internal review and revert with questions if any.   For the current use case, we have the option to connect the camera either over USB or Ethernet. Do you also have cameras that relay videos over LAN instead of USB?      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517  Absolutely Mike, thanks a ton for this. I am also marking the rest of the team on this email so nobody misses anything.   Hi Ash, Vivek – Mike has provided some rough calculations based on the info we provided. Request you to take a look.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which of our cameras  could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot or power.  But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s) with a short  enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when the box interrupts  the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse (up to 24V).  So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to see what is needed  there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx. 1.5 inches  wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box. You would  need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x 1,800. The  same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need multiple images  per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel (4000 x 3000) in  the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.   Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Nano_Benchmarks     Loan cameras:   We do have some of these cameras available as loan cameras, but my colleague Kevin is managing the loan program. I will get him involved if you  want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the card  if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson (if you want  to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can also discuss  that, if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

We are running against a tight timeline, and since we are not sure about the  right fit, it would be good to test both the camera systems at once.

Additionally, may I request to ship the camera and lens as soon as possible while we wait  for the inputs on strobe light from Mike?   Thanks.      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hi Vivek, the 16mm lens I have will not cover the 12 Mpixel sensor very well. The lens is designed for a 2/3” sensor, and the 12 Mpixel sensor is 1.1”, so coverage  at the edges will not be good. But, it would be adequate if you made a ROI for the center 5 Mpixels. I do have one lens that will cover the entire 12 Mpixel sensor, but it is a 35mm lens and may be the wrong focal length for you. Let me know what you think  of all this and if one configuration or the other sounds better. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the prompt response. This is the last piece of puzzle we need to solve before we can present the solution out in front of the customer. To close this  quickly and move to the production phase with them, time is of essence and as such anything you could do to expedite the lighting setup would go a long way.   Kevin,   We want to try out the model “MC124MG-SY-UB” with a 16mm lens as you have suggested given the availability conditions. I am assuming the dark edges you are talking  about will not cover more than 5% of the edges. Please let me know if this is not the case. Additionally, a 3m USB cable to go with it would be perfect.

If mono, I have only a MC124MG-SY-UB camera available at the moment. You can make the ROI smaller  to simulate the 5 Mpixel version as otherwise these cameras are identical (same pixel size and operation). I have a 16mm lens that will cover the area the 5 Mpixel version would need, but it does not completely cover all 12 Mpixels, so you will see some dark  edges when imaging with the whole focal plane. If you want a color camera, I do have the 5 Mpixel version. Let me know what other accessories you’d like with the loan (a 3m USB cable is typical). I will need your complete contact information in including ship  to address and phone number as well I’ll need a credit card to back the loan.

I’ll work with you to put a loan together when ready. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed insights. This sounds exciting.   Please find my answers inline in BLUE.     Kevin,   Nice to meet you. Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle  of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you  a range of focal lengths for the distance you gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction  of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we  can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens. Please let me know if you require any additional details.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Thank you, Mike. We'll confirm the FOV by early tomorrow.          To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    (+ Kevin)   Hi Ash,   I am adding Kevin to the thread, as he is managing our camera loan program. I have to check what we can do about the strobe light. We  don’t typically sell those, so we don’t have them as loan items either. But I will check and let you know.   The items you would need for your test are:   MC023MG-SY-UB (this is a monochrome camera) We can add a zoom lens, but I need to know what the desired field of view is (i.e., the area that you can guarantee contains the bar  code). The focal length of the lens will depend on that size. A mounting bracket and a USB3 cable is not an issue. We should also have a trigger cable that you can use.   For the strobe light I have to wait until I hear back from the company that we end up getting them from.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Good morning and hope you had a great weekend.    Can you please send us the following camera, strobe, and associated peripherals for development / trial? If this works, this would convert into a 200+ camera deal  to begin with and our footprint is massive on the current account, and growing heavily across the industry on a number of use case.     Camera Model: MC023MG-SY-UB with proper Zoom lens that can allow us to focus on moving carton on conveyer from a distance of about 36 to 48 inches Associated Strobe light that can be simultaneously triggered (either through Ximea or your partner) Proper camera mount that we can use   Associated peripherals   Below is the shipping address:   Ashutosh Prasad AMLI QUADRANGLE  2717 Howell St  APT #4114 DALLAS, TEXAS 75204    Additionally, we would also like to understand a bit more about the Xray and Hyperspectral cameras Ximea offers.   Please let me know in case of any questions.    @Hemdeep Ray  – Can you please send Mike our MNDA for signature? It would be good to have a MNDA in place as we jointly target large deals.   --  Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   We don’t make GigE cameras, as most of our customers must rely on getting images as fast as possible, and Ethernet networks can be clogged by other applications.    Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed overview. What you have articulated below looks great to me. We will do an internal review and revert with questions if any.   For the current use case, we have the option to connect the camera either over USB or Ethernet. Do you also have cameras that relay videos over LAN instead of USB?      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517  Absolutely Mike, thanks a ton for this. I am also marking the rest of the team on this email so nobody misses anything.   Hi Ash, Vivek – Mike has provided some rough calculations based on the info we provided. Request you to take a look.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which of  our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot  or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s) with  a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when the  box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse  (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to see what  is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx.  1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box.  You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x 1,800.  The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need  multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel  (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.   Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Nano_Benchmarks     Loan cameras:   We do have some of these cameras available as loan cameras, but my colleague Kevin is managing the loan program. I will get him involved  if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the  card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson (if  you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can also  discuss that, if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

The lens is designed for a 2/3” sensor, and the 12 Mpixel sensor is 1.1”, so coverage  at the edges will not be good. But, it would be adequate if you made a ROI for the center 5 Mpixels. I do have one lens that will cover the entire 12 Mpixel sensor, but it is a 35mm lens and may be the wrong focal length for you. Let me know what you think  of all this and if one configuration or the other sounds better. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the prompt response. This is the last piece of puzzle we need to solve before we can present the solution out in front of the customer. To close this  quickly and move to the production phase with them, time is of essence and as such anything you could do to expedite the lighting setup would go a long way.   Kevin,   We want to try out the model “MC124MG-SY-UB” with a 16mm lens as you have suggested given the availability conditions. I am assuming the dark edges you are talking  about will not cover more than 5% of the edges. Please let me know if this is not the case. Additionally, a 3m USB cable to go with it would be perfect. Would we need a power adapter too?   Ash will be sending out the address and the card information for processing shortly.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   Sure Mike, that would be great.

If mono, I have only a MC124MG-SY-UB camera available at the moment. You can make the ROI smaller  to simulate the 5 Mpixel version as otherwise these cameras are identical (same pixel size and operation). I have a 16mm lens that will cover the area the 5 Mpixel version would need, but it does not completely cover all 12 Mpixels, so you will see some dark  edges when imaging with the whole focal plane. If you want a color camera, I do have the 5 Mpixel version. Let me know what other accessories you’d like with the loan (a 3m USB cable is typical). I will need your complete contact information in including ship  to address and phone number as well I’ll need a credit card to back the loan.  Please fill out the attached form with your credit card information. Once completed, please send it via the Dropbox link below. You may call me at 303-389-9838 x210 if you prefer.   https://www.dropbox.com/request/rWULiT1x0jP2bZCElJwI    Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517      Hi Kevin,   Do let us know when the loan camera with the lens will be ready for delivery. If you could provide us with a date, we could work towards it.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Hi Vivek, I do have a 16mm lens that should cover our MC050MG camera. I’ll work with you to put a loan together when ready. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed insights. This sounds exciting.   Please find my answers inline in BLUE.     Kevin,   Nice to meet you. Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle  of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you  a range of focal lengths for the distance you gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction  of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we  can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens. Please let me know if you require any additional details.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Thank you, Mike. We'll confirm the FOV by early tomorrow.          To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    (+ Kevin)   Hi Ash,   I am adding Kevin to the thread, as he is managing our camera loan program. I have to check what we can do about the strobe light. We  don’t typically sell those, so we don’t have them as loan items either. But I will check and let you know.   The items you would need for your test are:   MC023MG-SY-UB (this is a monochrome camera) We can add a zoom lens, but I need to know what the desired field of view is (i.e., the area that you can guarantee contains the bar  code). The focal length of the lens will depend on that size. A mounting bracket and a USB3 cable is not an issue. We should also have a trigger cable that you can use.   For the strobe light I have to wait until I hear back from the company that we end up getting them from.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Good morning and hope you had a great weekend.    Can you please send us the following camera, strobe, and associated peripherals for development / trial? If this works, this would convert into a 200+ camera deal  to begin with and our footprint is massive on the current account, and growing heavily across the industry on a number of use case.     Camera Model: MC023MG-SY-UB with proper Zoom lens that can allow us to focus on moving carton on conveyer from a distance of about 36 to 48 inches Associated Strobe light that can be simultaneously triggered (either through Ximea or your partner) Proper camera mount that we can use   Associated peripherals   Below is the shipping address:   Ashutosh Prasad AMLI QUADRANGLE  2717 Howell St  APT #4114 DALLAS, TEXAS 75204    Additionally, we would also like to understand a bit more about the Xray and Hyperspectral cameras Ximea offers.   Please let me know in case of any questions.    @Hemdeep Ray  – Can you please send Mike our MNDA for signature? It would be good to have a MNDA in place as we jointly target large deals.   --  Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   We don’t make GigE cameras, as most of our customers must rely on getting images as fast as possible, and Ethernet networks can be clogged by other applications.    Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed overview. What you have articulated below looks great to me. We will do an internal review and revert with questions if any.   For the current use case, we have the option to connect the camera either over USB or Ethernet. Do you also have cameras that relay videos over LAN instead of USB?      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517  Absolutely Mike, thanks a ton for this. I am also marking the rest of the team on this email so nobody misses anything.   Hi Ash, Vivek – Mike has provided some rough calculations based on the info we provided. Request you to take a look.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which of  our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot  or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s) with  a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when the  box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse  (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to see what  is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx.  1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box.  You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x 1,800.  The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need  multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel  (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.   Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Nano_Benchmarks     Loan cameras:   We do have some of these cameras available as loan cameras, but my colleague Kevin is managing the loan program. I will get him involved  if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the  card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson (if  you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can also  discuss that, if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

We are running against a tight timeline, and since we are not sure about the right fit, it would  be good to test both the camera systems at once. We can return one of these immediately after our tests which shouldn’t take longer than a few days. Additionally, may I request to ship the camera and lens as soon as possible while we wait for the inputs on  strobe light from Mike?   Thanks.      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hi Vivek, the 16mm lens I have will not cover the 12 Mpixel sensor very well. The lens is designed for a 2/3” sensor, and the 12 Mpixel sensor is 1.1”, so coverage at the edges  will not be good. But, it would be adequate if you made a ROI for the center 5 Mpixels. I do have one lens that will cover the entire 12 Mpixel sensor, but it is a 35mm lens and may be the wrong focal length for you. Let me know what you think of all this  and if one configuration or the other sounds better. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the prompt response. This is the last piece of puzzle we need to solve before we can present the solution out in front of the customer. To close this quickly and  move to the production phase with them, time is of essence and as such anything you could do to expedite the lighting setup would go a long way.   Kevin,   We want to try out the model “MC124MG-SY-UB” with a 16mm lens as you have suggested given the availability conditions. I am assuming the dark edges you are talking about will not  cover more than 5% of the edges. Please let me know if this is not the case. Additionally, a 3m USB cable to go with it would be perfect. Would we need a power adapter too?   Ash will be sending out the address and the card information for processing shortly.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   Sure Mike, that would be great.

Please give me a few days to see what we can do.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517      Hello Kevin, Mike - Hope you are doing well, and had a relaxing weekend.       I am just checking in on the status of the lighting setup from the other manufacturer. I am afraid without it, we can't complete our internal  processes for the loaner. Meanwhile, @Vivek Prasadwill provid3 you with  the other pieces of information       Best,   Hemdeep       Get Outlook for Android       Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         Hi Kevin,       @Ashutosh Prasad has his boots on the ground  so either him or @Vivek Prasad will respond to your query soon.       Best,   Hemdeep       Get Outlook for Android          RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     [EXTERNAL]    Hi Aman, do you want a monochrome camera or color? If mono, I have only a MC124MG-SY-UB camera available at the moment. You can make the ROI smaller to simulate  the 5 Mpixel version as otherwise these cameras are identical (same pixel size and operation). I have a 16mm lens that will cover the area the 5 Mpixel version would need, but it does not completely cover all 12 Mpixels, so you will see some dark edges when  imaging with the whole focal plane. If you want a color camera, I do have the 5 Mpixel version. Let me know what other accessories you’d like with the loan (a 3m USB cable is typical). I will need your complete contact information in including ship to address  and phone number as well I’ll need a credit card to back the loan. Please fill out the attached form with your credit card information. Once completed, please send it via the Dropbox link below. You may call  me at 303-389-9838 x210 if you prefer.   https://www.dropbox.com/request/rWULiT1x0jP2bZCElJwI    Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517      Hi Kevin,   Do let us know when the loan camera with the lens will be ready for delivery. If you could provide us with a date, we could work towards it.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Hi Vivek, I do have a 16mm lens that should cover our MC050MG camera. I’ll work with you to put a loan together when ready. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed insights. This sounds exciting.   Please find my answers inline in BLUE.     Kevin,   Nice to meet you. Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of the  range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal  lengths for the distance you gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image,  or if the bar code algorithm can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner  package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens. Please let me know if you require any additional details.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Thank you, Mike. We'll confirm the FOV by early tomorrow.          To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    (+ Kevin)   Hi Ash,   I am adding Kevin to the thread, as he is managing our camera loan program. I have to check what we can do about the strobe light. We don’t typically  sell those, so we don’t have them as loan items either. But I will check and let you know.   The items you would need for your test are:   MC023MG-SY-UB (this is a monochrome camera) We can add a zoom lens, but I need to know what the desired field of view is (i.e., the area that you can guarantee contains the bar code). The  focal length of the lens will depend on that size. A mounting bracket and a USB3 cable is not an issue. We should also have a trigger cable that you can use.   For the strobe light I have to wait until I hear back from the company that we end up getting them from.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Good morning and hope you had a great weekend.    Can you please send us the following camera, strobe, and associated peripherals for development / trial? If this works, this would convert into a 200+ camera deal to begin  with and our footprint is massive on the current account, and growing heavily across the industry on a number of use case.     Camera Model: MC023MG-SY-UB with proper Zoom lens that can allow us to focus on moving carton on conveyer from a distance of about 36 to 48 inches Associated Strobe light that can be simultaneously triggered (either through Ximea or your partner) Proper camera mount that we can use  Associated peripherals   Below is the shipping address:   Ashutosh Prasad AMLI QUADRANGLE  2717 Howell St  APT #4114 DALLAS, TEXAS 75204    Additionally, we would also like to understand a bit more about the Xray and Hyperspectral cameras Ximea offers.   Please let me know in case of any questions.    @Hemdeep  Ray – Can you please send Mike our MNDA for signature? It would be good to have a MNDA in place as we jointly target large deals.   --  Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   We don’t make GigE cameras, as most of our customers must rely on getting images as fast as possible, and Ethernet networks can be clogged by other applications.    Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed overview. What you have articulated below looks great to me. We will do an internal review and revert with questions if any.   For the current use case, we have the option to connect the camera either over USB or Ethernet. Do you also have cameras that relay videos over LAN instead of USB?      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517  Absolutely Mike, thanks a ton for this. I am also marking the rest of the team on this email so nobody misses anything.   Hi Ash, Vivek – Mike has provided some rough calculations based on the info we provided. Request you to take a look.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which of our cameras  could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot or power.  But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s) with a short  enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when the box interrupts  the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse (up to 24V).  So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to see what is needed  there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx. 1.5 inches  wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box. You would  need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x 1,800. The same  calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need multiple images  per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel (4000 x 3000) in  the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.   Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Nano_Benchmarks     Loan cameras:   We do have some of these cameras available as loan cameras, but my colleague Kevin is managing the loan program. I will get him involved if you  want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the card  if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson (if you want  to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can also discuss  that, if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

We are running against a tight timeline, and since we are not sure about the  right fit, it would be good to test both the camera systems at once. We can return one of these immediately after our tests which shouldn’t take longer than a few days. Additionally, may I request to ship the camera and lens as soon as possible while we wait  for the inputs on strobe light from Mike?   Thanks.      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hi Vivek, the 16mm lens I have will not cover the 12 Mpixel sensor very well. The lens is designed for a 2/3” sensor, and the 12 Mpixel sensor is 1.1”, so coverage  at the edges will not be good. But, it would be adequate if you made a ROI for the center 5 Mpixels. I do have one lens that will cover the entire 12 Mpixel sensor, but it is a 35mm lens and may be the wrong focal length for you. Let me know what you think  of all this and if one configuration or the other sounds better. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the prompt response. This is the last piece of puzzle we need to solve before we can present the solution out in front of the customer. To close this  quickly and move to the production phase with them, time is of essence and as such anything you could do to expedite the lighting setup would go a long way.   Kevin,   We want to try out the model “MC124MG-SY-UB” with a 16mm lens as you have suggested given the availability conditions. I am assuming the dark edges you are talking  about will not cover more than 5% of the edges. Please let me know if this is not the case. Additionally, a 3m USB cable to go with it would be perfect. Would we need a power adapter too?   Ash will be sending out the address and the card information for processing shortly.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   Sure Mike, that would be great.

If mono, I have only a MC124MG-SY-UB camera available at the moment. You can make the ROI  smaller to simulate the 5 Mpixel version as otherwise these cameras are identical (same pixel size and operation). I have a 16mm lens that will cover the area the 5 Mpixel version would need, but it does not completely cover all 12 Mpixels, so you will see  some dark edges when imaging with the whole focal plane. If you want a color camera, I do have the 5 Mpixel version. Let me know what other accessories you’d like with the loan (a 3m USB cable is typical). I will need your complete contact information in including  ship to address and phone number as well I’ll need a credit card to back the loan.

If you could provide us with a date, we could work towards it.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Hi Vivek, I do have a 16mm lens that should cover our MC050MG camera. I’ll work with you to put a loan together when ready. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed insights. This sounds exciting.   Please find my answers inline in BLUE.     Kevin,   Nice to meet you. Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle  of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you  a range of focal lengths for the distance you gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction  of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we  can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens. Please let me know if you require any additional details.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Thank you, Mike. We'll confirm the FOV by early tomorrow.          To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    (+ Kevin)   Hi Ash,   I am adding Kevin to the thread, as he is managing our camera loan program. I have to check what we can do about the strobe light.  We don’t typically sell those, so we don’t have them as loan items either. But I will check and let you know.   The items you would need for your test are:   MC023MG-SY-UB (this is a monochrome camera) We can add a zoom lens, but I need to know what the desired field of view is (i.e., the area that you can guarantee contains the bar  code). The focal length of the lens will depend on that size. A mounting bracket and a USB3 cable is not an issue. We should also have a trigger cable that you can use.   For the strobe light I have to wait until I hear back from the company that we end up getting them from.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Good morning and hope you had a great weekend.    Can you please send us the following camera, strobe, and associated peripherals for development / trial? If this works, this would convert into a 200+ camera deal  to begin with and our footprint is massive on the current account, and growing heavily across the industry on a number of use case.     Camera Model: MC023MG-SY-UB with proper Zoom lens that can allow us to focus on moving carton on conveyer from a distance of about 36 to 48 inches Associated Strobe light that can be simultaneously triggered (either through Ximea or your partner) Proper camera mount that we can use   Associated peripherals   Below is the shipping address:   Ashutosh Prasad AMLI QUADRANGLE  2717 Howell St  APT #4114 DALLAS, TEXAS 75204    Additionally, we would also like to understand a bit more about the Xray and Hyperspectral cameras Ximea offers.   Please let me know in case of any questions.    @Hemdeep  Ray – Can you please send Mike our MNDA for signature? It would be good to have a MNDA in place as we jointly target large deals.   --  Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   We don’t make GigE cameras, as most of our customers must rely on getting images as fast as possible, and Ethernet networks can be clogged by other applications.    Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed overview. What you have articulated below looks great to me. We will do an internal review and revert with questions if any.   For the current use case, we have the option to connect the camera either over USB or Ethernet. Do you also have cameras that relay videos over LAN instead of USB?      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517  Absolutely Mike, thanks a ton for this. I am also marking the rest of the team on this email so nobody misses anything.   Hi Ash, Vivek – Mike has provided some rough calculations based on the info we provided. Request you to take a look.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which of  our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot  or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s) with  a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when the  box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse  (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to see what  is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx.  1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box.  You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x  1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000  x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need  multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel  (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.   Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Nano_Benchmarks     Loan cameras:   We do have some of these cameras available as loan cameras, but my colleague Kevin is managing the loan program. I will get him involved  if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the  card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson (if  you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can also  discuss that, if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

We are running against a tight timeline, and since we are not sure about the  right fit, it would be good to test both the camera systems at once. We can return one of these immediately after our tests which shouldn’t take longer than a few days. Additionally, may I request to ship the camera and lens as soon as possible while we wait  for the inputs on strobe light from Mike?   Thanks.      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hi Vivek, the 16mm lens I have will not cover the 12 Mpixel sensor very well. The lens is designed for a 2/3” sensor, and the 12 Mpixel sensor is 1.1”, so coverage at  the edges will not be good. But, it would be adequate if you made a ROI for the center 5 Mpixels. I do have one lens that will cover the entire 12 Mpixel sensor, but it is a 35mm lens and may be the wrong focal length for you. Let me know what you think of  all this and if one configuration or the other sounds better. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the prompt response. This is the last piece of puzzle we need to solve before we can present the solution out in front of the customer. To close this quickly  and move to the production phase with them, time is of essence and as such anything you could do to expedite the lighting setup would go a long way.   Kevin,   We want to try out the model “MC124MG-SY-UB” with a 16mm lens as you have suggested given the availability conditions. I am assuming the dark edges you are talking about  will not cover more than 5% of the edges. Please let me know if this is not the case. Additionally, a 3m USB cable to go with it would be perfect. Would we need a power adapter too?   Ash will be sending out the address and the card information for processing shortly.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   Sure Mike, that would be great.

If mono, I have only a MC124MG-SY-UB camera available at the moment. You can make the ROI smaller  to simulate the 5 Mpixel version as otherwise these cameras are identical (same pixel size and operation). I have a 16mm lens that will cover the area the 5 Mpixel version would need, but it does not completely cover all 12 Mpixels, so you will see some dark  edges when imaging with the whole focal plane. If you want a color camera, I do have the 5 Mpixel version. Let me know what other accessories you’d like with the loan (a 3m USB cable is typical). I will need your complete contact information in including ship  to address and phone number as well I’ll need a credit card to back the loan.

If you could provide us with a date, we could work towards it.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Hi Vivek, I do have a 16mm lens that should cover our MC050MG camera. I’ll work with you to put a loan together when ready. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed insights. This sounds exciting.   Please find my answers inline in BLUE.     Kevin,   Nice to meet you. Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle  of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a  range of focal lengths for the distance you gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction  of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can  put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens. Please let me know if you require any additional details.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Thank you, Mike. We'll confirm the FOV by early tomorrow.          To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    (+ Kevin)   Hi Ash,   I am adding Kevin to the thread, as he is managing our camera loan program. I have to check what we can do about the strobe light. We  don’t typically sell those, so we don’t have them as loan items either. But I will check and let you know.   The items you would need for your test are:   MC023MG-SY-UB (this is a monochrome camera) We can add a zoom lens, but I need to know what the desired field of view is (i.e., the area that you can guarantee contains the bar code).  The focal length of the lens will depend on that size. A mounting bracket and a USB3 cable is not an issue. We should also have a trigger cable that you can use.   For the strobe light I have to wait until I hear back from the company that we end up getting them from.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Good morning and hope you had a great weekend.    Can you please send us the following camera, strobe, and associated peripherals for development / trial? If this works, this would convert into a 200+ camera deal  to begin with and our footprint is massive on the current account, and growing heavily across the industry on a number of use case.     Camera Model: MC023MG-SY-UB with proper Zoom lens that can allow us to focus on moving carton on conveyer from a distance of about 36 to 48 inches Associated Strobe light that can be simultaneously triggered (either through Ximea or your partner) Proper camera mount that we can use   Associated peripherals   Below is the shipping address:   Ashutosh Prasad AMLI QUADRANGLE  2717 Howell St  APT #4114 DALLAS, TEXAS 75204    Additionally, we would also like to understand a bit more about the Xray and Hyperspectral cameras Ximea offers.   Please let me know in case of any questions.    @Hemdeep  Ray – Can you please send Mike our MNDA for signature? It would be good to have a MNDA in place as we jointly target large deals.   --  Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   We don’t make GigE cameras, as most of our customers must rely on getting images as fast as possible, and Ethernet networks can be clogged by other applications.    Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed overview. What you have articulated below looks great to me. We will do an internal review and revert with questions if any.   For the current use case, we have the option to connect the camera either over USB or Ethernet. Do you also have cameras that relay videos over LAN instead of USB?      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517  Absolutely Mike, thanks a ton for this. I am also marking the rest of the team on this email so nobody misses anything.   Hi Ash, Vivek – Mike has provided some rough calculations based on the info we provided. Request you to take a look.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which of our  cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot  or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s) with  a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when the  box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse  (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to see what  is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx. 1.5  inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box. You  would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x 1,800.  The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need multiple  images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel (4000 x 3000)  in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.   Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Nano_Benchmarks     Loan cameras:   We do have some of these cameras available as loan cameras, but my colleague Kevin is managing the loan program. I will get him involved  if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the  card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson (if  you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can also  discuss that, if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

We are running against a tight timeline, and since  we are not sure about the right fit, it would be good to test both the camera systems at once. We can return one of these immediately after our tests which shouldn’t take longer than a few days. Additionally, may I request to ship the camera and lens as soon  as possible while we wait for the inputs on strobe light from Mike?   Thanks.      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hi Vivek, the 16mm lens I have will not cover the 12 Mpixel sensor very well. The lens is designed for a 2/3” sensor, and the 12 Mpixel sensor is 1.1”, so coverage at the edges will not be good.  But, it would be adequate if you made a ROI for the center 5 Mpixels. I do have one lens that will cover the entire 12 Mpixel sensor, but it is a 35mm lens and may be the wrong focal length for you. Let me know what you think of all this and if one configuration  or the other sounds better. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the prompt response. This is the last piece of puzzle we need to solve before we can present the solution out in front of the customer. To close this quickly and move to the production  phase with them, time is of essence and as such anything you could do to expedite the lighting setup would go a long way.   Kevin,   We want to try out the model “MC124MG-SY-UB” with a 16mm lens as you have suggested given the availability conditions. I am assuming the dark edges you are talking about will not cover more than  5% of the edges. Please let me know if this is not the case. Additionally, a 3m USB cable to go with it would be perfect. Would we need a power adapter too?   Ash will be sending out the address and the card information for processing shortly.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   Sure Mike, that would be great.

If mono, I have only a MC124MG-SY-UB camera available at the moment. You can make the ROI smaller to simulate the 5 Mpixel  version as otherwise these cameras are identical (same pixel size and operation). I have a 16mm lens that will cover the area the 5 Mpixel version would need, but it does not completely cover all 12 Mpixels, so you will see some dark edges when imaging with  the whole focal plane. If you want a color camera, I do have the 5 Mpixel version. Let me know what other accessories you’d like with the loan (a 3m USB cable is typical). I will need your complete contact information in including ship to address and phone  number as well I’ll need a credit card to back the loan. Please fill out the attached form with your credit card information. Once completed, please send it via the Dropbox link below.

If you could provide us with a date, we could work towards it.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Hi Vivek, I do have a 16mm lens that should cover our MC050MG camera. I’ll work with you to put a loan together when ready. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed insights. This sounds exciting.   Please find my answers inline in BLUE.     Kevin,   Nice to meet you. Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of the range you gave  me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths for  the distance you gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if the bar  code algorithm can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner package together  for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens. Please let me know if you require any additional details.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Thank you, Mike. We'll confirm the FOV by early tomorrow.          To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    (+ Kevin)   Hi Ash,   I am adding Kevin to the thread, as he is managing our camera loan program. I have to check what we can do about the  strobe light. We don’t typically sell those, so we don’t have them as loan items either. But I will check and let you know.   The items you would need for your test are:   MC023MG-SY-UB (this is a monochrome camera) We can add a zoom lens, but I need to know what the desired field of view is (i.e., the area that you can guarantee contains  the bar code). The focal length of the lens will depend on that size. A mounting bracket and a USB3 cable is not an issue. We should also have a trigger cable that you can use.   For the strobe light I have to wait until I hear back from the company that we end up getting them from.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Good morning and hope you had a great weekend.    Can you please send us the following camera, strobe, and associated peripherals for development / trial? If this works, this would convert into a 200+ camera deal to begin with and our footprint  is massive on the current account, and growing heavily across the industry on a number of use case.     Camera Model: MC023MG-SY-UB with proper Zoom lens that can allow us to focus on moving carton on conveyer from a distance of about 36 to 48 inches Associated Strobe light that can be simultaneously triggered (either through Ximea or your partner) Proper camera mount that we can use  Associated peripherals   Below is the shipping address:   Ashutosh Prasad AMLI QUADRANGLE  2717 Howell St  APT #4114 DALLAS, TEXAS 75204    Additionally, we would also like to understand a bit more about the Xray and Hyperspectral cameras Ximea offers.   Please let me know in case of any questions.    @Hemdeep Ray  – Can you please send Mike our MNDA for signature? It would be good to have a MNDA in place as we jointly target large deals.   --  Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   We don’t make GigE cameras, as most of our customers must rely on getting images as fast as possible, and Ethernet networks can be clogged by other applications.    Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed overview. What you have articulated below looks great to me. We will do an internal review and revert with questions if any.   For the current use case, we have the option to connect the camera either over USB or Ethernet. Do you also have cameras that relay videos over LAN instead of USB?      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517  Absolutely Mike, thanks a ton for this. I am also marking the rest of the team on this email so nobody misses anything.   Hi Ash, Vivek – Mike has provided some rough calculations based on the info we provided. Request you to take a look.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and  see which of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot,  and use a lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the  bar codes(s) with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt,  and when the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple  voltage pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light  to see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code  is approx. 1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area  of the box. You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly  2,400 x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like  4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means  you will need multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even  the 12 Mpixel (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.   Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Nano_Benchmarks     Loan cameras:   We do have some of these cameras available as loan cameras, but my colleague Kevin is managing the loan program. I will  get him involved if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be  no charges on the card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put  the Jetson (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson.  We can also discuss that, if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

We are running against a tight timeline, and since we are not sure  about the right fit, it would be good to test both the camera systems at once. We can return one of these immediately after our tests which shouldn’t take longer than a few days. Additionally, may I request to ship the camera and lens as soon as possible while  we wait for the inputs on strobe light from Mike?   Thanks.      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hi Vivek, the 16mm lens I have will not cover the 12 Mpixel sensor very well. The lens is designed for a 2/3” sensor, and the 12 Mpixel sensor is 1.1”, so coverage at the edges will not be good. But, it would  be adequate if you made a ROI for the center 5 Mpixels. I do have one lens that will cover the entire 12 Mpixel sensor, but it is a 35mm lens and may be the wrong focal length for you. Let me know what you think of all this and if one configuration or the  other sounds better. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the prompt response. This is the last piece of puzzle we need to solve before we can present the solution out in front of the customer. To close this quickly and move to the production phase with  them, time is of essence and as such anything you could do to expedite the lighting setup would go a long way.   Kevin,   We want to try out the model “MC124MG-SY-UB” with a 16mm lens as you have suggested given the availability conditions. I am assuming the dark edges you are talking about will not cover more than 5% of the edges.  Please let me know if this is not the case. Additionally, a 3m USB cable to go with it would be perfect. Would we need a power adapter too?   Ash will be sending out the address and the card information for processing shortly.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   Sure Mike, that would be great.

If mono, I have only a MC124MG-SY-UB camera available at the moment. You can make the ROI smaller to simulate the 5 Mpixel version as otherwise  these cameras are identical (same pixel size and operation). I have a 16mm lens that will cover the area the 5 Mpixel version would need, but it does not completely cover all 12 Mpixels, so you will see some dark edges when imaging with the whole focal plane.  If you want a color camera, I do have the 5 Mpixel version. Let me know what other accessories you’d like with the loan (a 3m USB cable is typical). I will need your complete contact information in including ship to address and phone number as well I’ll need  a credit card to back the loan.

If you could provide us with a date, we could work towards it.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Hi Vivek, I do have a 16mm lens that should cover our MC050MG camera. I’ll work with you to put a loan together when ready. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed insights. This sounds exciting.   Please find my answers inline in BLUE.     Kevin,   Nice to meet you. Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths for the distance you  gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if the bar code algorithm  can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens. Please let me know if you require any additional details.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Thank you, Mike. We'll confirm the FOV by early tomorrow.          To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    (+ Kevin)   Hi Ash,   I am adding Kevin to the thread, as he is managing our camera loan program. I have to check what we can do about the strobe light.  We don’t typically sell those, so we don’t have them as loan items either. But I will check and let you know.   The items you would need for your test are:   MC023MG-SY-UB (this is a monochrome camera) We can add a zoom lens, but I need to know what the desired field of view is (i.e., the area that you can guarantee contains the  bar code). The focal length of the lens will depend on that size. A mounting bracket and a USB3 cable is not an issue. We should also have a trigger cable that you can use.   For the strobe light I have to wait until I hear back from the company that we end up getting them from.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Good morning and hope you had a great weekend.    Can you please send us the following camera, strobe, and associated peripherals for development / trial? If this works, this would convert into a 200+ camera deal to begin with and our footprint is massive  on the current account, and growing heavily across the industry on a number of use case.     Camera Model: MC023MG-SY-UB with proper Zoom lens that can allow us to focus on moving carton on conveyer from a distance of about 36 to 48 inches Associated Strobe light that can be simultaneously triggered (either through Ximea or your partner) Proper camera mount that we can use  Associated peripherals   Below is the shipping address:   Ashutosh Prasad AMLI QUADRANGLE  2717 Howell St  APT #4114 DALLAS, TEXAS 75204    Additionally, we would also like to understand a bit more about the Xray and Hyperspectral cameras Ximea offers.   Please let me know in case of any questions.    @Hemdeep Ray  – Can you please send Mike our MNDA for signature? It would be good to have a MNDA in place as we jointly target large deals.   --  Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   We don’t make GigE cameras, as most of our customers must rely on getting images as fast as possible, and Ethernet networks can be clogged by other applications.    Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed overview. What you have articulated below looks great to me. We will do an internal review and revert with questions if any.   For the current use case, we have the option to connect the camera either over USB or Ethernet. Do you also have cameras that relay videos over LAN instead of USB?      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517  Absolutely Mike, thanks a ton for this. I am also marking the rest of the team on this email so nobody misses anything.   Hi Ash, Vivek – Mike has provided some rough calculations based on the info we provided. Request you to take a look.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which  of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use  a lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s)  with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when  the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to  see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx.  1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box.  You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400  x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000  x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will  need multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel  (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.   Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Nano_Benchmarks     Loan cameras:   We do have some of these cameras available as loan cameras, but my colleague Kevin is managing the loan program. I will get him  involved if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges  on the card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson  (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can  also discuss that, if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

We are running against a tight timeline, and since we are not  sure about the right fit, it would be good to test both the camera systems at once. We can return one of these immediately after our tests which shouldn’t take longer than a few days. Additionally, may I request to ship the camera and lens as soon as possible  while we wait for the inputs on strobe light from Mike?   Thanks.      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hi Vivek, the 16mm lens I have will not cover the 12 Mpixel sensor very well. The lens is designed for a 2/3” sensor, and the 12 Mpixel sensor is 1.1”, so coverage at the edges will not be good. But, it would  be adequate if you made a ROI for the center 5 Mpixels. I do have one lens that will cover the entire 12 Mpixel sensor, but it is a 35mm lens and may be the wrong focal length for you. Let me know what you think of all this and if one configuration or the  other sounds better. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the prompt response. This is the last piece of puzzle we need to solve before we can present the solution out in front of the customer. To close this quickly and move to the production phase with  them, time is of essence and as such anything you could do to expedite the lighting setup would go a long way.   Kevin,   We want to try out the model “MC124MG-SY-UB” with a 16mm lens as you have suggested given the availability conditions. I am assuming the dark edges you are talking about will not cover more than 5% of the edges.  Please let me know if this is not the case. Additionally, a 3m USB cable to go with it would be perfect. Would we need a power adapter too?   Ash will be sending out the address and the card information for processing shortly.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   Sure Mike, that would be great.

If mono, I have only a MC124MG-SY-UB camera available at the moment. You can make the ROI smaller to simulate the 5 Mpixel version as  otherwise these cameras are identical (same pixel size and operation). I have a 16mm lens that will cover the area the 5 Mpixel version would need, but it does not completely cover all 12 Mpixels, so you will see some dark edges when imaging with the whole  focal plane. If you want a color camera, I do have the 5 Mpixel version. Let me know what other accessories you’d like with the loan (a 3m USB cable is typical). I will need your complete contact information in including ship to address and phone number as  well I’ll need a credit card to back the loan.

If you could provide us with a date, we could work towards it.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Hi Vivek, I do have a 16mm lens that should cover our MC050MG camera. I’ll work with you to put a loan together when ready. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed insights. This sounds exciting.   Please find my answers inline in BLUE.     Kevin,   Nice to meet you. Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths for the distance you  gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if the bar code algorithm  can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens. Please let me know if you require any additional details.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Thank you, Mike. We'll confirm the FOV by early tomorrow.          To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    (+ Kevin)   Hi Ash,   I am adding Kevin to the thread, as he is managing our camera loan program. I have to check what we can do about the strobe light.  We don’t typically sell those, so we don’t have them as loan items either. But I will check and let you know.   The items you would need for your test are:   MC023MG-SY-UB (this is a monochrome camera) We can add a zoom lens, but I need to know what the desired field of view is (i.e., the area that you can guarantee contains the  bar code). The focal length of the lens will depend on that size. A mounting bracket and a USB3 cable is not an issue. We should also have a trigger cable that you can use.   For the strobe light I have to wait until I hear back from the company that we end up getting them from.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Good morning and hope you had a great weekend.    Can you please send us the following camera, strobe, and associated peripherals for development / trial? If this works, this would convert into a 200+ camera deal to begin with and our footprint is massive  on the current account, and growing heavily across the industry on a number of use case.     Camera Model: MC023MG-SY-UB with proper Zoom lens that can allow us to focus on moving carton on conveyer from a distance of about 36 to 48 inches Associated Strobe light that can be simultaneously triggered (either through Ximea or your partner) Proper camera mount that we can use  Associated peripherals   Below is the shipping address:   Ashutosh Prasad AMLI QUADRANGLE  2717 Howell St  APT #4114 DALLAS, TEXAS 75204    Additionally, we would also like to understand a bit more about the Xray and Hyperspectral cameras Ximea offers.   Please let me know in case of any questions.    @Hemdeep Ray  – Can you please send Mike our MNDA for signature? It would be good to have a MNDA in place as we jointly target large deals.   --  Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   We don’t make GigE cameras, as most of our customers must rely on getting images as fast as possible, and Ethernet networks can be clogged by other applications.    Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed overview. What you have articulated below looks great to me. We will do an internal review and revert with questions if any.   For the current use case, we have the option to connect the camera either over USB or Ethernet. Do you also have cameras that relay videos over LAN instead of USB?      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517  Absolutely Mike, thanks a ton for this. I am also marking the rest of the team on this email so nobody misses anything.   Hi Ash, Vivek – Mike has provided some rough calculations based on the info we provided. Request you to take a look.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which  of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use  a lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s)  with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when  the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to  see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx.  1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box.  You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400  x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000  x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will  need multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel  (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.   Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Nano_Benchmarks     Loan cameras:   We do have some of these cameras available as loan cameras, but my colleague Kevin is managing the loan program. I will get him  involved if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges  on the card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson  (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can  also discuss that, if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

We are running against a tight timeline, and since we are not sure  about the right fit, it would be good to test both the camera systems at once. We can return one of these immediately after our tests which shouldn’t take longer than a few days. Additionally, may I request to ship the camera and lens as soon as possible while  we wait for the inputs on strobe light from Mike?   Thanks.      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hi Vivek, the 16mm lens I have will not cover the 12 Mpixel sensor very well. The lens is designed for a 2/3” sensor, and the 12 Mpixel sensor is 1.1”, so coverage at the edges will not be good. But, it would be  adequate if you made a ROI for the center 5 Mpixels. I do have one lens that will cover the entire 12 Mpixel sensor, but it is a 35mm lens and may be the wrong focal length for you. Let me know what you think of all this and if one configuration or the other  sounds better. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the prompt response. This is the last piece of puzzle we need to solve before we can present the solution out in front of the customer. To close this quickly and move to the production phase with  them, time is of essence and as such anything you could do to expedite the lighting setup would go a long way.   Kevin,   We want to try out the model “MC124MG-SY-UB” with a 16mm lens as you have suggested given the availability conditions. I am assuming the dark edges you are talking about will not cover more than 5% of the edges.  Please let me know if this is not the case. Additionally, a 3m USB cable to go with it would be perfect. Would we need a power adapter too?   Ash will be sending out the address and the card information for processing shortly.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   Sure Mike, that would be great.

If mono, I have only a MC124MG-SY-UB camera available at the moment. You can make the ROI smaller to simulate the 5 Mpixel version as otherwise  these cameras are identical (same pixel size and operation). I have a 16mm lens that will cover the area the 5 Mpixel version would need, but it does not completely cover all 12 Mpixels, so you will see some dark edges when imaging with the whole focal plane.  If you want a color camera, I do have the 5 Mpixel version. Let me know what other accessories you’d like with the loan (a 3m USB cable is typical). I will need your complete contact information in including ship to address and phone number as well I’ll need  a credit card to back the loan.

If you could provide us with a date, we could work towards it.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Hi Vivek, I do have a 16mm lens that should cover our MC050MG camera. I’ll work with you to put a loan together when ready. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed insights. This sounds exciting.   Please find my answers inline in BLUE.     Kevin,   Nice to meet you. Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths for the distance you  gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can  deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens. Please let me know if you require any additional details.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Thank you, Mike. We'll confirm the FOV by early tomorrow.          To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    (+ Kevin)   Hi Ash,   I am adding Kevin to the thread, as he is managing our camera loan program. I have to check what we can do about the strobe light.  We don’t typically sell those, so we don’t have them as loan items either. But I will check and let you know.   The items you would need for your test are:   MC023MG-SY-UB (this is a monochrome camera) We can add a zoom lens, but I need to know what the desired field of view is (i.e., the area that you can guarantee contains the  bar code). The focal length of the lens will depend on that size. A mounting bracket and a USB3 cable is not an issue. We should also have a trigger cable that you can use.   For the strobe light I have to wait until I hear back from the company that we end up getting them from.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Good morning and hope you had a great weekend.    Can you please send us the following camera, strobe, and associated peripherals for development / trial? If this works, this would convert into a 200+ camera deal to begin with and our footprint is massive  on the current account, and growing heavily across the industry on a number of use case.     Camera Model: MC023MG-SY-UB with proper Zoom lens that can allow us to focus on moving carton on conveyer from a distance of about 36 to 48 inches Associated Strobe light that can be simultaneously triggered (either through Ximea or your partner) Proper camera mount that we can use  Associated peripherals   Below is the shipping address:   Ashutosh Prasad AMLI QUADRANGLE  2717 Howell St  APT #4114 DALLAS, TEXAS 75204    Additionally, we would also like to understand a bit more about the Xray and Hyperspectral cameras Ximea offers.   Please let me know in case of any questions.    @Hemdeep Ray  – Can you please send Mike our MNDA for signature? It would be good to have a MNDA in place as we jointly target large deals.   --  Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   We don’t make GigE cameras, as most of our customers must rely on getting images as fast as possible, and Ethernet networks can be clogged by other applications.    Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed overview. What you have articulated below looks great to me. We will do an internal review and revert with questions if any.   For the current use case, we have the option to connect the camera either over USB or Ethernet. Do you also have cameras that relay videos over LAN instead of USB?      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517  Absolutely Mike, thanks a ton for this. I am also marking the rest of the team on this email so nobody misses anything.   Hi Ash, Vivek – Mike has provided some rough calculations based on the info we provided. Request you to take a look.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which  of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use  a lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s)  with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when  the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to  see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx.  1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box.  You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400  x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000  x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need  multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel  (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.   Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Nano_Benchmarks     Loan cameras:   We do have some of these cameras available as loan cameras, but my colleague Kevin is managing the loan program. I will get him  involved if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges  on the card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson  (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can  also discuss that, if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

We are running against a tight timeline, and since we are not sure  about the right fit, it would be good to test both the camera systems at once. We can return one of these immediately after our tests which shouldn’t take longer than a few days. Additionally, may I request to ship the camera and lens as soon as possible while  we wait for the inputs on strobe light from Mike?   Thanks.      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hi Vivek, the 16mm lens I have will not cover the 12 Mpixel sensor very well. The lens is designed for a 2/3” sensor, and the 12 Mpixel sensor is 1.1”, so coverage at the edges will not be good. But, it would be  adequate if you made a ROI for the center 5 Mpixels. I do have one lens that will cover the entire 12 Mpixel sensor, but it is a 35mm lens and may be the wrong focal length for you. Let me know what you think of all this and if one configuration or the other  sounds better. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the prompt response. This is the last piece of puzzle we need to solve before we can present the solution out in front of the customer. To close this quickly and move to the production phase with them,  time is of essence and as such anything you could do to expedite the lighting setup would go a long way.   Kevin,   We want to try out the model “MC124MG-SY-UB” with a 16mm lens as you have suggested given the availability conditions. I am assuming the dark edges you are talking about will not cover more than 5% of the edges.  Please let me know if this is not the case. Additionally, a 3m USB cable to go with it would be perfect. Would we need a power adapter too?   Ash will be sending out the address and the card information for processing shortly.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   Sure Mike, that would be great.

If mono, I have only a MC124MG-SY-UB camera available at the moment. You can make the ROI smaller to simulate the 5 Mpixel version as otherwise  these cameras are identical (same pixel size and operation). I have a 16mm lens that will cover the area the 5 Mpixel version would need, but it does not completely cover all 12 Mpixels, so you will see some dark edges when imaging with the whole focal plane.  If you want a color camera, I do have the 5 Mpixel version. Let me know what other accessories you’d like with the loan (a 3m USB cable is typical). I will need your complete contact information in including ship to address and phone number as well I’ll need  a credit card to back the loan.

If you could provide us with a date, we could work towards it.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Hi Vivek, I do have a 16mm lens that should cover our MC050MG camera. I’ll work with you to put a loan together when ready. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed insights. This sounds exciting.   Please find my answers inline in  BLUE.     Kevin,   Nice to meet you. Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths for the distance you gave  me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can  deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens. Please let me know if you require any additional details.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Thank you, Mike. We'll confirm the FOV by early tomorrow.          To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    (+ Kevin)   Hi Ash,   I am adding Kevin to the thread, as he is managing our camera loan program. I have to check what we can do about the strobe light. We  don’t typically sell those, so we don’t have them as loan items either. But I will check and let you know.   The items you would need for your test are:   MC023MG-SY-UB (this is a monochrome camera) We can add a zoom lens, but I need to know what the desired field of view is (i.e., the area that you can guarantee contains the bar  code). The focal length of the lens will depend on that size. A mounting bracket and a USB3 cable is not an issue. We should also have a trigger cable that you can use.   For the strobe light I have to wait until I hear back from the company that we end up getting them from.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Good morning and hope you had a great weekend.    Can you please send us the following camera, strobe, and associated peripherals for development / trial? If this works, this would convert into a 200+ camera deal to begin with and our footprint is massive on  the current account, and growing heavily across the industry on a number of use case.     Camera Model: MC023MG-SY-UB with proper Zoom lens that can allow us to focus on moving carton on conveyer from a distance of about 36 to 48 inches Associated Strobe light that can be simultaneously triggered (either through Ximea or your partner) Proper camera mount that we can use  Associated peripherals   Below is the shipping address:   Ashutosh Prasad AMLI QUADRANGLE  2717 Howell St  APT #4114 DALLAS, TEXAS 75204    Additionally, we would also like to understand a bit more about the Xray and Hyperspectral cameras Ximea offers.   Please let me know in case of any questions.    @Hemdeep Ray  – Can you please send Mike our MNDA for signature? It would be good to have a MNDA in place as we jointly target large deals.   --  Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   We don’t make GigE cameras, as most of our customers must rely on getting images as fast as possible, and Ethernet networks can be clogged by other applications.    Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed overview. What you have articulated below looks great to me. We will do an internal review and revert with questions if any.   For the current use case, we have the option to connect the camera either over USB or Ethernet. Do you also have cameras that relay videos over LAN instead of USB?      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517  Absolutely Mike, thanks a ton for this. I am also marking the rest of the team on this email so nobody misses anything.   Hi Ash, Vivek – Mike has provided some rough calculations based on the info we provided. Request you to take a look.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which of  our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot  or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s) with  a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when the  box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse  (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to see what  is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx.  1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box.  You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x 1,800.  The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need  multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel  (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.   Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Nano_Benchmarks     Loan cameras:   We do have some of these cameras available as loan cameras, but my colleague Kevin is managing the loan program. I will get him involved  if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the  card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson (if  you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can also  discuss that, if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

We are running against a tight timeline, and since we are not sure  about the right fit, it would be good to test both the camera systems at once. We can return one of these immediately after our tests which shouldn’t take longer than a few days. Additionally, may I request to ship the camera and lens as soon as possible while  we wait for the inputs on strobe light from Mike?   Thanks.      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hi Vivek, the 16mm lens I have will not cover the 12 Mpixel sensor very well. The lens is designed for a 2/3” sensor, and the 12 Mpixel sensor is 1.1”, so coverage at the edges will not be good. But, it would be  adequate if you made a ROI for the center 5 Mpixels. I do have one lens that will cover the entire 12 Mpixel sensor, but it is a 35mm lens and may be the wrong focal length for you. Let me know what you think of all this and if one configuration or the other  sounds better. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the prompt response. This is the last piece of puzzle we need to solve before we can present the solution out in front of the customer. To close this quickly and move to the production phase with them,  time is of essence and as such anything you could do to expedite the lighting setup would go a long way.   Kevin,   We want to try out the model “MC124MG-SY-UB” with a 16mm lens as you have suggested given the availability conditions. I am assuming the dark edges you are talking about will not cover more than 5% of the edges.  Please let me know if this is not the case. Additionally, a 3m USB cable to go with it would be perfect. Would we need a power adapter too?   Ash will be sending out the address and the card information for processing shortly.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   Sure Mike, that would be great.

If mono, I have only a MC124MG-SY-UB camera available at the moment. You can make the ROI smaller to simulate the 5 Mpixel version as otherwise  these cameras are identical (same pixel size and operation). I have a 16mm lens that will cover the area the 5 Mpixel version would need, but it does not completely cover all 12 Mpixels, so you will see some dark edges when imaging with the whole focal plane.  If you want a color camera, I do have the 5 Mpixel version. Let me know what other accessories you’d like with the loan (a 3m USB cable is typical). I will need your complete contact information in including ship to address and phone number as well I’ll need  a credit card to back the loan.

If you could provide us with a date, we could work towards it.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Hi Vivek, I do have a 16mm lens that should cover our MC050MG camera. I’ll work with you to put a loan together when ready. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed insights. This sounds exciting.   Please find my answers inline in BLUE.     Kevin,   Nice to meet you. Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths for the distance you gave  me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can  deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:    What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging.What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:  The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width.The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches.Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches.Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face.The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens. Please let me know if you require any additional details.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Thank you, Mike. We'll confirm the FOV by early tomorrow.          To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    (+ Kevin)   Hi Ash,   I am adding Kevin to the thread, as he is managing our camera loan program. I have to check what we can do about the strobe light.  We don’t typically sell those, so we don’t have them as loan items either. But I will check and let you know.   The items you would need for your test are:   MC023MG-SY-UB (this is a monochrome camera) We can add a zoom lens, but I need to know what the desired field of view is (i.e., the area that you can guarantee contains the  bar code). The focal length of the lens will depend on that size. A mounting bracket and a USB3 cable is not an issue. We should also have a trigger cable that you can use.   For the strobe light I have to wait until I hear back from the company that we end up getting them from.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Good morning and hope you had a great weekend.    Can you please send us the following camera, strobe, and associated peripherals for development / trial? If this works, this would convert into a 200+ camera deal to begin with and our footprint is massive on  the current account, and growing heavily across the industry on a number of use case.     Camera Model: MC023MG-SY-UB with proper Zoom lens that can allow us to focus on moving carton on conveyer from a distance of about 36 to 48 inches Associated Strobe light that can be simultaneously triggered (either through Ximea or your partner) Proper camera mount that we can use  Associated peripherals   Below is the shipping address:   Ashutosh Prasad AMLI QUADRANGLE  2717 Howell St  APT #4114 DALLAS, TEXAS 75204    Additionally, we would also like to understand a bit more about the Xray and Hyperspectral cameras Ximea offers.   Please let me know in case of any questions.    @Hemdeep Ray  – Can you please send Mike our MNDA for signature? It would be good to have a MNDA in place as we jointly target large deals.   --  Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   We don’t make GigE cameras, as most of our customers must rely on getting images as fast as possible, and Ethernet networks can be clogged by other applications.    Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed overview. What you have articulated below looks great to me. We will do an internal review and revert with questions if any.   For the current use case, we have the option to connect the camera either over USB or Ethernet. Do you also have cameras that relay videos over LAN instead of USB?      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517  Absolutely Mike, thanks a ton for this. I am also marking the rest of the team on this email so nobody misses anything.   Hi Ash, Vivek – Mike has provided some rough calculations based on the info we provided. Request you to take a look.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which  of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a  lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s)  with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when  the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to  see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx.  1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box.  You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400  x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000  x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need  multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel  (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.   Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Nano_Benchmarks     Loan cameras:   We do have some of these cameras available as loan cameras, but my colleague Kevin is managing the loan program. I will get him involved  if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the  card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson  (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can  also discuss that, if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

We are running against a tight timeline, and since we are not sure  about the right fit, it would be good to test both the camera systems at once. We can return one of these immediately after our tests which shouldn’t take longer than a few days. Additionally, may I request to ship the camera and lens as soon as possible while  we wait for the inputs on strobe light from Mike?   Thanks.      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hi Vivek, the 16mm lens I have will not cover the 12 Mpixel sensor very well. The lens is designed for a 2/3” sensor, and the 12 Mpixel sensor is 1.1”, so coverage at the edges will not be good. But, it would be adequate  if you made a ROI for the center 5 Mpixels. I do have one lens that will cover the entire 12 Mpixel sensor, but it is a 35mm lens and may be the wrong focal length for you. Let me know what you think of all this and if one configuration or the other sounds  better. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the prompt response. This is the last piece of puzzle we need to solve before we can present the solution out in front of the customer. To close this quickly and move to the production phase with them,  time is of essence and as such anything you could do to expedite the lighting setup would go a long way.   Kevin,   We want to try out the model “MC124MG-SY-UB” with a 16mm lens as you have suggested given the availability conditions. I am assuming the dark edges you are talking about will not cover more than 5% of the edges. Please  let me know if this is not the case. Additionally, a 3m USB cable to go with it would be perfect. Would we need a power adapter too?   Ash will be sending out the address and the card information for processing shortly.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   Sure Mike, that would be great.

If mono, I have only a MC124MG-SY-UB camera available at the moment. You can make the ROI smaller to simulate the 5 Mpixel version as otherwise  these cameras are identical (same pixel size and operation). I have a 16mm lens that will cover the area the 5 Mpixel version would need, but it does not completely cover all 12 Mpixels, so you will see some dark edges when imaging with the whole focal plane.  If you want a color camera, I do have the 5 Mpixel version. Let me know what other accessories you’d like with the loan (a 3m USB cable is typical). I will need your complete contact information in including ship to address and phone number as well I’ll need  a credit card to back the loan.

If you could provide us with a date, we could work towards it.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Hi Vivek, I do have a 16mm lens that should cover our MC050MG camera. I’ll work with you to put a loan together when ready. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed insights. This sounds exciting.   Please find my answers inline in  BLUE.     Kevin,   Nice to meet you. Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths for the distance you gave  me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can  deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens. Please let me know if you require any additional details.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Thank you, Mike. We'll confirm the FOV by early tomorrow.          To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    (+ Kevin)   Hi Ash,   I am adding Kevin to the thread, as he is managing our camera loan program. I have to check what we can do about the strobe light. We  don’t typically sell those, so we don’t have them as loan items either. But I will check and let you know.   The items you would need for your test are:   MC023MG-SY-UB (this is a monochrome camera) We can add a zoom lens, but I need to know what the desired field of view is (i.e., the area that you can guarantee contains the bar  code). The focal length of the lens will depend on that size. A mounting bracket and a USB3 cable is not an issue. We should also have a trigger cable that you can use.   For the strobe light I have to wait until I hear back from the company that we end up getting them from.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Good morning and hope you had a great weekend.    Can you please send us the following camera, strobe, and associated peripherals for development / trial? If this works, this would convert into a 200+ camera deal to begin with and our footprint is massive on  the current account, and growing heavily across the industry on a number of use case.     Camera Model: MC023MG-SY-UB with proper Zoom lens that can allow us to focus on moving carton on conveyer from a distance of about 36 to 48 inches Associated Strobe light that can be simultaneously triggered (either through Ximea or your partner) Proper camera mount that we can use  Associated peripherals   Below is the shipping address:   Ashutosh Prasad AMLI QUADRANGLE  2717 Howell St  APT #4114 DALLAS, TEXAS 75204    Additionally, we would also like to understand a bit more about the Xray and Hyperspectral cameras Ximea offers.   Please let me know in case of any questions.    @Hemdeep Ray  – Can you please send Mike our MNDA for signature? It would be good to have a MNDA in place as we jointly target large deals.   --  Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   We don’t make GigE cameras, as most of our customers must rely on getting images as fast as possible, and Ethernet networks can be clogged by other applications.    Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed overview. What you have articulated below looks great to me. We will do an internal review and revert with questions if any.   For the current use case, we have the option to connect the camera either over USB or Ethernet. Do you also have cameras that relay videos over LAN instead of USB?      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517  Absolutely Mike, thanks a ton for this. I am also marking the rest of the team on this email so nobody misses anything.   Hi Ash, Vivek – Mike has provided some rough calculations based on the info we provided. Request you to take a look.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which of  our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot  or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s) with  a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when the  box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse  (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to see what  is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx. 1.5  inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box. You  would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x 1,800.  The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need multiple  images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel (4000 x 3000)  in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.   Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Nano_Benchmarks     Loan cameras:   We do have some of these cameras available as loan cameras, but my colleague Kevin is managing the loan program. I will get him involved  if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the  card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson (if  you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can also  discuss that, if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

"Thanks Mike.      >>On the other hand, with a smaller sensor (like the MC050 we had initially discussed) you can find lenses with a 5mm  focal length, which would give you about an 80 degree viewing angle.     We’re looking for attributes to differentiate amongst 800+ SKUs with accuracy. So the image details is key for us.      To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/   --  Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517      [EXTERNAL]   Hi Ashutosh,   just wanted to get back to you on the lens options.    There are no real options for a 5mm lens for the 12 MPix camera that you have. The reason is that the area that is in focus behind the lens has a spherical surface, and the bigger the sensor, the harder it is to get the entire sensor  surface in focus. I am not aware of a 5mm lens for a 1.1” sensor. For example, Schneider Kreuznach, who make excellent (albeit somewhat expensive) lenses have a 12 mm lens (which would give you a 60 degree viewing angle).    On the other hand, with a smaller sensor (like the MC050 we had initially discussed) you can find lenses with a 5mm focal length, which would give you about an 80 degree viewing angle.   Can you tell me a bit more about the application and the restrictions you have regarding camera placement? Perhaps I can find another way to get you what you need. Kevin is setting up a conference call for next week. If you prefer, we  can discuss this during the call.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Thank you, Kevin.   We’ve started use of the color camera on a different use case where we need to use a different lens for a closer view of product attributes. Can you please suggest lens options for the color camera you’d provided? Vivek was thinking of  5 mm but would like to understand the range of options available below 16 mm. Additionally, we are installing the camera on mount this Saturday for testing so if there is any way to receive a loaner lens for this new use case, it would be of great help.  The  footprint of this deal is about 300+ cameras.    --  Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hi all, you’ll see the loan agreement shortly. These lights are not a product of ours so I have a number of outstanding questions about their function, but I got them to work with some basic triggering, however not in conjunction with  a camera. There is very little documentation about how to use them, but it seems straight forward enough. You must supply the lights with 24V (power supply included) and then with a 5V trigger to get them to pulse. I’ll include the specification sheet for  them which will give you the pinout at least. Hopefully you have a good experience with them. I  have extended your loan(s) to a due date of April 29.  Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517        And yes, can you please send us the loan agreement for the light for the monochrome camera?

But currently we’re using continuous light and it’d be good to switch to triggered light and  see how the system performs in tandem.        The next frontier for us would be to figure out how to provide a protective casing for the camera to make it dust proof. If you can provide any insights into how to go about it (including  or a third-party vendor), we can declare victory on this use case from a production deployment perspective and go to the final negotiation with much more confidence.        We have also expanded our footprint at the customer and exploring 4K color cameras (anticipated demand 450 cameras) where we need to observe SKU attributes at less than 0.5 mph from a  max of 1-2 feet distance). Would you have any recommendations here?         To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Hi Everybody,   Hope everybody is doing well.   I just wanted to follow up on the loan cameras and see if you need any further help with those, and if you think they will work for you. Please let me know. Also, we had discussed lights in case the exposure times get too low for good images. We now have an LED light panel here that can be triggered (or run in steady state mode), and I think you had expressed interest to add that to the  loan. Let me know if that is still of interest.   Looking forward to your response.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517        Thanks Kevin. Our FedEx account number is 558878320.          To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Hi Ashutosh, can you send along your preferred carrier account number?

We are running against a tight timeline, and since we are not  sure about the right fit, it would be good to test both the camera systems at once. We can return one of these immediately after our tests which shouldn’t take longer than a few days. Additionally, may I request to ship the camera and lens as soon as possible  while we wait for the inputs on strobe light from Mike?   Thanks.      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hi Vivek, the 16mm lens I have will not cover the 12 Mpixel sensor very well. The lens is designed for a 2/3” sensor, and the 12 Mpixel sensor is 1.1”, so coverage at the edges will not be good. But, it would  be adequate if you made a ROI for the center 5 Mpixels. I do have one lens that will cover the entire 12 Mpixel sensor, but it is a 35mm lens and may be the wrong focal length for you. Let me know what you think of all this and if one configuration or the  other sounds better. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the prompt response. This is the last piece of puzzle we need to solve before we can present the solution out in front of the customer. To close this quickly and move to the production phase with  them, time is of essence and as such anything you could do to expedite the lighting setup would go a long way.   Kevin,   We want to try out the model “MC124MG-SY-UB” with a 16mm lens as you have suggested given the availability conditions. I am assuming the dark edges you are talking about will not cover more than 5% of the edges.  Please let me know if this is not the case. Additionally, a 3m USB cable to go with it would be perfect. Would we need a power adapter too?   Ash will be sending out the address and the card information for processing shortly.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   Sure Mike, that would be great.

If mono, I have only a MC124MG-SY-UB camera available at the moment. You can make the ROI smaller to simulate the 5 Mpixel version as  otherwise these cameras are identical (same pixel size and operation). I have a 16mm lens that will cover the area the 5 Mpixel version would need, but it does not completely cover all 12 Mpixels, so you will see some dark edges when imaging with the whole  focal plane. If you want a color camera, I do have the 5 Mpixel version. Let me know what other accessories you’d like with the loan (a 3m USB cable is typical). I will need your complete contact information in including ship to address and phone number as  well I’ll need a credit card to back the loan.

Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Hi Vivek, I do have a 16mm lens that should cover our MC050MG camera. I’ll work with you to put a loan together when ready. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed insights. This sounds exciting.   Please find my answers inline in BLUE.     Kevin,   Nice to meet you. Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths for the distance you  gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if the bar code algorithm  can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens. Please let me know if you require any additional details.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Thank you, Mike. We'll confirm the FOV by early tomorrow.          To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    (+ Kevin)   Hi Ash,   I am adding Kevin to the thread, as he is managing our camera loan program. I have to check what we can do about the strobe light.  We don’t typically sell those, so we don’t have them as loan items either. But I will check and let you know.   The items you would need for your test are:   MC023MG-SY-UB (this is a monochrome camera) We can add a zoom lens, but I need to know what the desired field of view is (i.e., the area that you can guarantee contains the  bar code). The focal length of the lens will depend on that size. A mounting bracket and a USB3 cable is not an issue. We should also have a trigger cable that you can use.   For the strobe light I have to wait until I hear back from the company that we end up getting them from.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Good morning and hope you had a great weekend.    Can you please send us the following camera, strobe, and associated peripherals for development / trial? If this works, this would convert into a 200+ camera deal to begin with and our footprint is massive  on the current account, and growing heavily across the industry on a number of use case.     Camera Model: MC023MG-SY-UB with proper Zoom lens that can allow us to focus on moving carton on conveyer from a distance of about 36 to 48 inches Associated Strobe light that can be simultaneously triggered (either through Ximea or your partner) Proper camera mount that we can use  Associated peripherals   Below is the shipping address:   Ashutosh Prasad AMLI QUADRANGLE  2717 Howell St  APT #4114 DALLAS, TEXAS 75204    Additionally, we would also like to understand a bit more about the Xray and Hyperspectral cameras Ximea offers.   Please let me know in case of any questions.    @Hemdeep Ray  – Can you please send Mike our MNDA for signature? It would be good to have a MNDA in place as we jointly target large deals.   --  Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   We don’t make GigE cameras, as most of our customers must rely on getting images as fast as possible, and Ethernet networks can be clogged by other applications.    Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed overview. What you have articulated below looks great to me. We will do an internal review and revert with questions if any.   For the current use case, we have the option to connect the camera either over USB or Ethernet. Do you also have cameras that relay videos over LAN instead of USB?      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517  Absolutely Mike, thanks a ton for this. I am also marking the rest of the team on this email so nobody misses anything.   Hi Ash, Vivek – Mike has provided some rough calculations based on the info we provided. Request you to take a look.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which  of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use  a lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s)  with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when  the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to  see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx.  1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box.  You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400  x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000  x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will  need multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel  (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.   Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Nano_Benchmarks     Loan cameras:   We do have some of these cameras available as loan cameras, but my colleague Kevin is managing the loan program. I will get him  involved if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges  on the card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson  (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can  also discuss that, if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

"Thank you, Kevin.   We’ve started use of the color camera on a different use case where we need to use a different lens for a closer view of product attributes. Can you please suggest lens options for the color camera you’d provided? Vivek was thinking of  5 mm but would like to understand the range of options available below 16 mm. Additionally, we are installing the camera on mount this Saturday for testing so if there is any way to receive a loaner lens for this new use case, it would be of great help.  The  footprint of this deal is about 300+ cameras.    --  Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hi all, you’ll see the loan agreement shortly. These lights are not a product of ours so I have a number of outstanding questions about their function, but I got them to work with some basic triggering, however not in conjunction with a  camera. There is very little documentation about how to use them, but it seems straight forward enough. You must supply the lights with 24V (power supply included) and then with a 5V trigger to get them to pulse. I’ll include the specification sheet for them  which will give you the pinout at least. Hopefully you have a good experience with them. I  have extended your loan(s) to a due date of April 29.  Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517        And yes, can you please send us the loan agreement for the light for the monochrome camera?

But currently we’re using continuous light and it’d be good to switch to triggered light and  see how the system performs in tandem.        The next frontier for us would be to figure out how to provide a protective casing for the camera to make it dust proof. If you can provide any insights into how to go about it (including  or a third-party vendor), we can declare victory on this use case from a production deployment perspective and go to the final negotiation with much more confidence.        We have also expanded our footprint at the customer and exploring 4K color cameras (anticipated demand 450 cameras) where we need to observe SKU attributes at less than 0.5 mph from a max  of 1-2 feet distance). Would you have any recommendations here?         To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Hi Everybody,   Hope everybody is doing well.   I just wanted to follow up on the loan cameras and see if you need any further help with those, and if you think they will work for you. Please let me know. Also, we had discussed lights in case the exposure times get too low for good images.

We are running against a tight timeline, and since we are not sure  about the right fit, it would be good to test both the camera systems at once. We can return one of these immediately after our tests which shouldn’t take longer than a few days. Additionally, may I request to ship the camera and lens as soon as possible while  we wait for the inputs on strobe light from Mike?   Thanks.      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hi Vivek, the 16mm lens I have will not cover the 12 Mpixel sensor very well. The lens is designed for a 2/3” sensor, and the 12 Mpixel sensor is 1.1”, so coverage at the edges will not be good. But, it would be  adequate if you made a ROI for the center 5 Mpixels. I do have one lens that will cover the entire 12 Mpixel sensor, but it is a 35mm lens and may be the wrong focal length for you. Let me know what you think of all this and if one configuration or the other  sounds better. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the prompt response. This is the last piece of puzzle we need to solve before we can present the solution out in front of the customer. To close this quickly and move to the production phase with  them, time is of essence and as such anything you could do to expedite the lighting setup would go a long way.   Kevin,   We want to try out the model “MC124MG-SY-UB” with a 16mm lens as you have suggested given the availability conditions. I am assuming the dark edges you are talking about will not cover more than 5% of the edges.  Please let me know if this is not the case. Additionally, a 3m USB cable to go with it would be perfect. Would we need a power adapter too?   Ash will be sending out the address and the card information for processing shortly.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   Sure Mike, that would be great.

If mono, I have only a MC124MG-SY-UB camera available at the moment. You can make the ROI smaller to simulate the 5 Mpixel version as otherwise  these cameras are identical (same pixel size and operation). I have a 16mm lens that will cover the area the 5 Mpixel version would need, but it does not completely cover all 12 Mpixels, so you will see some dark edges when imaging with the whole focal plane.  If you want a color camera, I do have the 5 Mpixel version. Let me know what other accessories you’d like with the loan (a 3m USB cable is typical). I will need your complete contact information in including ship to address and phone number as well I’ll need  a credit card to back the loan.

Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Hi Vivek, I do have a 16mm lens that should cover our MC050MG camera. I’ll work with you to put a loan together when ready. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed insights. This sounds exciting.   Please find my answers inline in BLUE.     Kevin,   Nice to meet you. Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths for the distance you  gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can  deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens. Please let me know if you require any additional details.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Thank you, Mike. We'll confirm the FOV by early tomorrow.          To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    (+ Kevin)   Hi Ash,   I am adding Kevin to the thread, as he is managing our camera loan program. I have to check what we can do about the strobe light.  We don’t typically sell those, so we don’t have them as loan items either. But I will check and let you know.   The items you would need for your test are:   MC023MG-SY-UB (this is a monochrome camera) We can add a zoom lens, but I need to know what the desired field of view is (i.e., the area that you can guarantee contains the bar  code). The focal length of the lens will depend on that size. A mounting bracket and a USB3 cable is not an issue. We should also have a trigger cable that you can use.   For the strobe light I have to wait until I hear back from the company that we end up getting them from.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Good morning and hope you had a great weekend.    Can you please send us the following camera, strobe, and associated peripherals for development / trial? If this works, this would convert into a 200+ camera deal to begin with and our footprint is massive  on the current account, and growing heavily across the industry on a number of use case.     Camera Model: MC023MG-SY-UB with proper Zoom lens that can allow us to focus on moving carton on conveyer from a distance of about 36 to 48 inches Associated Strobe light that can be simultaneously triggered (either through Ximea or your partner) Proper camera mount that we can use  Associated peripherals   Below is the shipping address:   Ashutosh Prasad AMLI QUADRANGLE  2717 Howell St  APT #4114 DALLAS, TEXAS 75204    Additionally, we would also like to understand a bit more about the Xray and Hyperspectral cameras Ximea offers.   Please let me know in case of any questions.    @Hemdeep Ray  – Can you please send Mike our MNDA for signature?

What you have articulated below looks great to me. We will do an internal review and revert with questions if any.   For the current use case, we have the option to connect the camera either over USB or Ethernet. Do you also have cameras that relay videos over LAN instead of USB?      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517  Absolutely Mike, thanks a ton for this. I am also marking the rest of the team on this email so nobody misses anything.   Hi Ash, Vivek – Mike has provided some rough calculations based on the info we provided. Request you to take a look.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which  of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a  lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s)  with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when  the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to  see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx.  1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box.  You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x  1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000  x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need  multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel  (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.   Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Nano_Benchmarks     Loan cameras:   We do have some of these cameras available as loan cameras, but my colleague Kevin is managing the loan program. I will get him involved  if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the  card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson  (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can  also discuss that, if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

"Hi all, you’ll see the loan agreement shortly. These lights are not a product of ours so I have a number of outstanding questions about their function, but I got them to work with some basic triggering, however not in conjunction with a  camera. There is very little documentation about how to use them, but it seems straight forward enough. You must supply the lights with 24V (power supply included) and then with a 5V trigger to get them to pulse. I’ll include the specification sheet for them  which will give you the pinout at least. Hopefully you have a good experience with them. I  have extended your loan(s) to a due date of April 29.  Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517        And yes, can you please send us the loan agreement for the light for the monochrome camera?

But currently we’re using continuous light and it’d be good to switch to triggered light and  see how the system performs in tandem.        The next frontier for us would be to figure out how to provide a protective casing for the camera to make it dust proof. If you can provide any insights into how to go about it (including  or a third-party vendor), we can declare victory on this use case from a production deployment perspective and go to the final negotiation with much more confidence.        We have also expanded our footprint at the customer and exploring 4K color cameras (anticipated demand 450 cameras) where we need to observe SKU attributes at less than 0.5 mph from a max  of 1-2 feet distance). Would you have any recommendations here?         To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Hi Everybody,   Hope everybody is doing well.   I just wanted to follow up on the loan cameras and see if you need any further help with those, and if you think they will work for you.

We are running against a tight timeline, and since we are not sure  about the right fit, it would be good to test both the camera systems at once. We can return one of these immediately after our tests which shouldn’t take longer than a few days. Additionally, may I request to ship the camera and lens as soon as possible while  we wait for the inputs on strobe light from Mike?   Thanks.      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hi Vivek, the 16mm lens I have will not cover the 12 Mpixel sensor very well. The lens is designed for a 2/3” sensor, and the 12 Mpixel sensor is 1.1”, so coverage at the edges will not be good. But, it would be  adequate if you made a ROI for the center 5 Mpixels. I do have one lens that will cover the entire 12 Mpixel sensor, but it is a 35mm lens and may be the wrong focal length for you. Let me know what you think of all this and if one configuration or the other  sounds better. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the prompt response. This is the last piece of puzzle we need to solve before we can present the solution out in front of the customer. To close this quickly and move to the production phase with  them, time is of essence and as such anything you could do to expedite the lighting setup would go a long way.   Kevin,   We want to try out the model “MC124MG-SY-UB” with a 16mm lens as you have suggested given the availability conditions. I am assuming the dark edges you are talking about will not cover more than 5% of the edges.  Please let me know if this is not the case. Additionally, a 3m USB cable to go with it would be perfect. Would we need a power adapter too?   Ash will be sending out the address and the card information for processing shortly.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   Sure Mike, that would be great.

If mono, I have only a MC124MG-SY-UB camera available at the moment. You can make the ROI smaller to simulate the 5 Mpixel version as otherwise  these cameras are identical (same pixel size and operation). I have a 16mm lens that will cover the area the 5 Mpixel version would need, but it does not completely cover all 12 Mpixels, so you will see some dark edges when imaging with the whole focal plane.  If you want a color camera, I do have the 5 Mpixel version. Let me know what other accessories you’d like with the loan (a 3m USB cable is typical). I will need your complete contact information in including ship to address and phone number as well I’ll need  a credit card to back the loan.

Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Hi Vivek, I do have a 16mm lens that should cover our MC050MG camera. I’ll work with you to put a loan together when ready. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed insights. This sounds exciting.   Please find my answers inline in BLUE.     Kevin,   Nice to meet you. Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths for the distance you  gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can  deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens. Please let me know if you require any additional details.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Thank you, Mike. We'll confirm the FOV by early tomorrow.          To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    (+ Kevin)   Hi Ash,   I am adding Kevin to the thread, as he is managing our camera loan program. I have to check what we can do about the strobe light.  We don’t typically sell those, so we don’t have them as loan items either. But I will check and let you know.   The items you would need for your test are:   MC023MG-SY-UB (this is a monochrome camera) We can add a zoom lens, but I need to know what the desired field of view is (i.e., the area that you can guarantee contains the bar  code). The focal length of the lens will depend on that size. A mounting bracket and a USB3 cable is not an issue. We should also have a trigger cable that you can use.   For the strobe light I have to wait until I hear back from the company that we end up getting them from.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Good morning and hope you had a great weekend.    Can you please send us the following camera, strobe, and associated peripherals for development / trial?

Do you also have cameras that relay videos over LAN instead of USB?      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517  Absolutely Mike, thanks a ton for this. I am also marking the rest of the team on this email so nobody misses anything.   Hi Ash, Vivek – Mike has provided some rough calculations based on the info we provided. Request you to take a look.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which  of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a  lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s)  with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when  the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to  see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx.  1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box.  You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x  1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000  x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need  multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel  (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.   Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Nano_Benchmarks     Loan cameras:   We do have some of these cameras available as loan cameras, but my colleague Kevin is managing the loan program. I will get him involved  if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the  card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson  (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can  also discuss that, if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

"And yes, can you please send us the loan agreement for the light for the monochrome camera?

But currently we’re using continuous light and it’d be good to switch to triggered light and  see how the system performs in tandem.    The next frontier for us would be to figure out how to provide a protective casing for the camera to make it dust proof. If you can provide any insights into how to go about it (including  or a third-party vendor), we can declare victory on this use case from a production deployment perspective and go to the final negotiation with much more confidence.    We have also expanded our footprint at the customer and exploring 4K color cameras (anticipated demand 450 cameras) where we need to observe SKU attributes at less than 0.5 mph from  a max of 1-2 feet distance). Would you have any recommendations here?

We are running against a tight timeline, and since we are not  sure about the right fit, it would be good to test both the camera systems at once. We can return one of these immediately after our tests which shouldn’t take longer than a few days. Additionally, may I request to ship the camera and lens as soon as possible  while we wait for the inputs on strobe light from Mike?   Thanks.      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hi Vivek, the 16mm lens I have will not cover the 12 Mpixel sensor very well. The lens is designed for a 2/3” sensor, and the 12 Mpixel sensor is 1.1”, so coverage at the edges will not be good. But, it would  be adequate if you made a ROI for the center 5 Mpixels. I do have one lens that will cover the entire 12 Mpixel sensor, but it is a 35mm lens and may be the wrong focal length for you. Let me know what you think of all this and if one configuration or the  other sounds better. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the prompt response. This is the last piece of puzzle we need to solve before we can present the solution out in front of the customer. To close this quickly and move to the production phase with  them, time is of essence and as such anything you could do to expedite the lighting setup would go a long way.   Kevin,   We want to try out the model “MC124MG-SY-UB” with a 16mm lens as you have suggested given the availability conditions. I am assuming the dark edges you are talking about will not cover more than 5% of the edges.  Please let me know if this is not the case. Additionally, a 3m USB cable to go with it would be perfect. Would we need a power adapter too?   Ash will be sending out the address and the card information for processing shortly.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   Sure Mike, that would be great.

If mono, I have only a MC124MG-SY-UB camera available at the moment. You can make the ROI smaller to simulate the 5 Mpixel version as  otherwise these cameras are identical (same pixel size and operation). I have a 16mm lens that will cover the area the 5 Mpixel version would need, but it does not completely cover all 12 Mpixels, so you will see some dark edges when imaging with the whole  focal plane. If you want a color camera, I do have the 5 Mpixel version. Let me know what other accessories you’d like with the loan (a 3m USB cable is typical). I will need your complete contact information in including ship to address and phone number as  well I’ll need a credit card to back the loan.

I’ll work with you to put a loan together when ready. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed insights. This sounds exciting.   Please find my answers inline in BLUE.     Kevin,   Nice to meet you. Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths for the distance you  gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if the bar code algorithm  can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens. Please let me know if you require any additional details.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Thank you, Mike. We'll confirm the FOV by early tomorrow.          To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    (+ Kevin)   Hi Ash,   I am adding Kevin to the thread, as he is managing our camera loan program. I have to check what we can do about the strobe light.  We don’t typically sell those, so we don’t have them as loan items either. But I will check and let you know.   The items you would need for your test are:   MC023MG-SY-UB (this is a monochrome camera) We can add a zoom lens, but I need to know what the desired field of view is (i.e., the area that you can guarantee contains the  bar code). The focal length of the lens will depend on that size. A mounting bracket and a USB3 cable is not an issue. We should also have a trigger cable that you can use.   For the strobe light I have to wait until I hear back from the company that we end up getting them from.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Good morning and hope you had a great weekend.    Can you please send us the following camera, strobe, and associated peripherals for development / trial?

I am also marking the rest of the team on this email so nobody misses anything.   Hi Ash, Vivek – Mike has provided some rough calculations based on the info we provided. Request you to take a look.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which  of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use  a lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s)  with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when  the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to  see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx.  1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box.  You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400  x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000  x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will  need multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel  (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.   Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Nano_Benchmarks     Loan cameras:   We do have some of these cameras available as loan cameras, but my colleague Kevin is managing the loan program. I will get him  involved if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges  on the card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson  (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can  also discuss that, if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

"Mike,     All’s progressing well and the monochrome camera helped us with the conveyer belt use case. But currently we’re using continuous light and it’d be good to switch to triggered light and see how the system performs in tandem.      The next frontier for us would be to figure out how to provide a protective casing for the camera to make it dust proof. If you can provide any insights into how to go about it (including or a third-party vendor), we can declare victory on this use case from  a production deployment perspective and go to the final negotiation with much more confidence.      We have also expanded our footprint at the customer and exploring 4K color cameras (anticipated demand 450 cameras) where we need to observe SKU attributes at less than 0.5 mph from a max of 1-2 feet distance). Would you have  any recommendations here?

We are running against a tight timeline, and since we are not sure  about the right fit, it would be good to test both the camera systems at once. We can return one of these immediately after our tests which shouldn’t take longer than a few days. Additionally, may I request to ship the camera and lens as soon as possible while  we wait for the inputs on strobe light from Mike?   Thanks.      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hi Vivek, the 16mm lens I have will not cover the 12 Mpixel sensor very well. The lens is designed for a 2/3” sensor, and the 12 Mpixel sensor is 1.1”, so coverage at the edges will not be good. But, it would be  adequate if you made a ROI for the center 5 Mpixels. I do have one lens that will cover the entire 12 Mpixel sensor, but it is a 35mm lens and may be the wrong focal length for you. Let me know what you think of all this and if one configuration or the other  sounds better. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the prompt response. This is the last piece of puzzle we need to solve before we can present the solution out in front of the customer. To close this quickly and move to the production phase with  them, time is of essence and as such anything you could do to expedite the lighting setup would go a long way.   Kevin,   We want to try out the model “MC124MG-SY-UB” with a 16mm lens as you have suggested given the availability conditions. I am assuming the dark edges you are talking about will not cover more than 5% of the edges.  Please let me know if this is not the case. Additionally, a 3m USB cable to go with it would be perfect. Would we need a power adapter too?   Ash will be sending out the address and the card information for processing shortly.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   Sure Mike, that would be great.

If mono, I have only a MC124MG-SY-UB camera available at the moment. You can make the ROI smaller to simulate the 5 Mpixel version as otherwise  these cameras are identical (same pixel size and operation). I have a 16mm lens that will cover the area the 5 Mpixel version would need, but it does not completely cover all 12 Mpixels, so you will see some dark edges when imaging with the whole focal plane.  If you want a color camera, I do have the 5 Mpixel version. Let me know what other accessories you’d like with the loan (a 3m USB cable is typical). I will need your complete contact information in including ship to address and phone number as well I’ll need  a credit card to back the loan.

This sounds exciting.   Please find my answers inline in BLUE.     Kevin,   Nice to meet you. Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths for the distance you  gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can  deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens. Please let me know if you require any additional details.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Thank you, Mike. We'll confirm the FOV by early tomorrow.          To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    (+ Kevin)   Hi Ash,   I am adding Kevin to the thread, as he is managing our camera loan program. I have to check what we can do about the strobe light.  We don’t typically sell those, so we don’t have them as loan items either. But I will check and let you know.   The items you would need for your test are:   MC023MG-SY-UB (this is a monochrome camera) We can add a zoom lens, but I need to know what the desired field of view is (i.e., the area that you can guarantee contains the  bar code). The focal length of the lens will depend on that size. A mounting bracket and a USB3 cable is not an issue. We should also have a trigger cable that you can use.   For the strobe light I have to wait until I hear back from the company that we end up getting them from.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Good morning and hope you had a great weekend.    Can you please send us the following camera, strobe, and associated peripherals for development / trial?

I am also marking the rest of the team on this email so nobody misses anything.   Hi Ash, Vivek – Mike has provided some rough calculations based on the info we provided. Request you to take a look.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which  of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use  a lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s)  with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when  the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to  see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx.  1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box.  You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400  x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000  x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need  multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel  (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.   Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Nano_Benchmarks     Loan cameras:   We do have some of these cameras available as loan cameras, but my colleague Kevin is managing the loan program. I will get him  involved if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges  on the card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson  (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can  also discuss that, if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

We are running against a tight timeline, and since we are not sure  about the right fit, it would be good to test both the camera systems at once. We can return one of these immediately after our tests which shouldn’t take longer than a few days. Additionally, may I request to ship the camera and lens as soon as possible while  we wait for the inputs on strobe light from Mike?   Thanks.      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hi Vivek, the 16mm lens I have will not cover the 12 Mpixel sensor very well. The lens is designed for a 2/3” sensor, and the 12 Mpixel sensor is 1.1”, so coverage at the edges will not be good. But, it would be  adequate if you made a ROI for the center 5 Mpixels. I do have one lens that will cover the entire 12 Mpixel sensor, but it is a 35mm lens and may be the wrong focal length for you. Let me know what you think of all this and if one configuration or the other  sounds better. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the prompt response. This is the last piece of puzzle we need to solve before we can present the solution out in front of the customer.

I am assuming the dark edges you are talking about will not cover more than 5% of the edges.  Please let me know if this is not the case. Additionally, a 3m USB cable to go with it would be perfect. Would we need a power adapter too?   Ash will be sending out the address and the card information for processing shortly.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   Sure Mike, that would be great.

If mono, I have only a MC124MG-SY-UB camera available at the moment. You can make the ROI smaller to simulate the 5 Mpixel version as otherwise  these cameras are identical (same pixel size and operation). I have a 16mm lens that will cover the area the 5 Mpixel version would need, but it does not completely cover all 12 Mpixels, so you will see some dark edges when imaging with the whole focal plane.  If you want a color camera, I do have the 5 Mpixel version. Let me know what other accessories you’d like with the loan (a 3m USB cable is typical). I will need your complete contact information in including ship to address and phone number as well I’ll need  a credit card to back the loan.

This sounds exciting.   Please find my answers inline in BLUE.     Kevin,   Nice to meet you. Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths for the distance you  gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can  deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens. Please let me know if you require any additional details.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Thank you, Mike. We'll confirm the FOV by early tomorrow.          To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    (+ Kevin)   Hi Ash,   I am adding Kevin to the thread, as he is managing our camera loan program. I have to check what we can do about the strobe light.  We don’t typically sell those, so we don’t have them as loan items either. But I will check and let you know.   The items you would need for your test are:   MC023MG-SY-UB (this is a monochrome camera) We can add a zoom lens, but I need to know what the desired field of view is (i.e., the area that you can guarantee contains the  bar code). The focal length of the lens will depend on that size. A mounting bracket and a USB3 cable is not an issue. We should also have a trigger cable that you can use.   For the strobe light I have to wait until I hear back from the company that we end up getting them from.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Good morning and hope you had a great weekend.    Can you please send us the following camera, strobe, and associated peripherals for development / trial?

I am also marking the rest of the team on this email so nobody misses anything.   Hi Ash, Vivek – Mike has provided some rough calculations based on the info we provided. Request you to take a look.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which  of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use  a lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s)  with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when  the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to  see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx.  1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box.  You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400  x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000  x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need  multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel  (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.   Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Nano_Benchmarks     Loan cameras:   We do have some of these cameras available as loan cameras, but my colleague Kevin is managing the loan program. I will get him  involved if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges  on the card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson  (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can  also discuss that, if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

We are running against a tight timeline, and since we are not sure  about the right fit, it would be good to test both the camera systems at once. We can return one of these immediately after our tests which shouldn’t take longer than a few days. Additionally, may I request to ship the camera and lens as soon as possible while  we wait for the inputs on strobe light from Mike?   Thanks.      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hi Vivek, the 16mm lens I have will not cover the 12 Mpixel sensor very well. The lens is designed for a 2/3” sensor, and the 12 Mpixel sensor is 1.1”, so coverage at the edges will not be good. But, it would be  adequate if you made a ROI for the center 5 Mpixels. I do have one lens that will cover the entire 12 Mpixel sensor, but it is a 35mm lens and may be the wrong focal length for you. Let me know what you think of all this and if one configuration or the other  sounds better. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the prompt response. This is the last piece of puzzle we need to solve before we can present the solution out in front of the customer. To close this quickly and move to the production phase with them,  time is of essence and as such anything you could do to expedite the lighting setup would go a long way.   Kevin,   We want to try out the model “MC124MG-SY-UB” with a 16mm lens as you have suggested given the availability conditions. I am assuming the dark edges you are talking about will not cover more than 5% of the edges.  Please let me know if this is not the case. Additionally, a 3m USB cable to go with it would be perfect. Would we need a power adapter too?   Ash will be sending out the address and the card information for processing shortly.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   Sure Mike, that would be great.

If mono, I have only a MC124MG-SY-UB camera available at the moment. You can make the ROI smaller to simulate the 5 Mpixel version as otherwise  these cameras are identical (same pixel size and operation). I have a 16mm lens that will cover the area the 5 Mpixel version would need, but it does not completely cover all 12 Mpixels, so you will see some dark edges when imaging with the whole focal plane.  If you want a color camera, I do have the 5 Mpixel version. Let me know what other accessories you’d like with the loan (a 3m USB cable is typical). I will need your complete contact information in including ship to address and phone number as well I’ll need  a credit card to back the loan.

Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Hi Vivek, I do have a 16mm lens that should cover our MC050MG camera. I’ll work with you to put a loan together when ready. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed insights. This sounds exciting.   Please find my answers inline in BLUE.     Kevin,   Nice to meet you. Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths for the distance you gave  me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can  deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:    What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging.What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:  The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width.The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches.Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches.Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face.The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens. Please let me know if you require any additional details.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Thank you, Mike. We'll confirm the FOV by early tomorrow.          To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    (+ Kevin)   Hi Ash,   I am adding Kevin to the thread, as he is managing our camera loan program. I have to check what we can do about the strobe light.  We don’t typically sell those, so we don’t have them as loan items either. But I will check and let you know.   The items you would need for your test are:   MC023MG-SY-UB (this is a monochrome camera) We can add a zoom lens, but I need to know what the desired field of view is (i.e., the area that you can guarantee contains the  bar code). The focal length of the lens will depend on that size. A mounting bracket and a USB3 cable is not an issue. We should also have a trigger cable that you can use.   For the strobe light I have to wait until I hear back from the company that we end up getting them from.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Good morning and hope you had a great weekend.    Can you please send us the following camera, strobe, and associated peripherals for development / trial?

Do you also have cameras that relay videos over LAN instead of USB?      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517  Absolutely Mike, thanks a ton for this. I am also marking the rest of the team on this email so nobody misses anything.   Hi Ash, Vivek – Mike has provided some rough calculations based on the info we provided. Request you to take a look.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which  of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a  lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s)  with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when  the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to  see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx.  1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box.  You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400  x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000  x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need  multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel  (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.   Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Nano_Benchmarks     Loan cameras:   We do have some of these cameras available as loan cameras, but my colleague Kevin is managing the loan program. I will get him involved  if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the  card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson  (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can  also discuss that, if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

We are running against a tight timeline, and since we are not sure  about the right fit, it would be good to test both the camera systems at once. We can return one of these immediately after our tests which shouldn’t take longer than a few days. Additionally, may I request to ship the camera and lens as soon as possible while  we wait for the inputs on strobe light from Mike?   Thanks.      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hi Vivek, the 16mm lens I have will not cover the 12 Mpixel sensor very well. The lens is designed for a 2/3” sensor, and the 12 Mpixel sensor is 1.1”, so coverage at the edges will not be good. But, it would be  adequate if you made a ROI for the center 5 Mpixels. I do have one lens that will cover the entire 12 Mpixel sensor, but it is a 35mm lens and may be the wrong focal length for you. Let me know what you think of all this and if one configuration or the other  sounds better. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the prompt response. This is the last piece of puzzle we need to solve before we can present the solution out in front of the customer. To close this quickly and move to the production phase with them,  time is of essence and as such anything you could do to expedite the lighting setup would go a long way.   Kevin,   We want to try out the model “MC124MG-SY-UB” with a 16mm lens as you have suggested given the availability conditions. I am assuming the dark edges you are talking about will not cover more than 5% of the edges.  Please let me know if this is not the case. Additionally, a 3m USB cable to go with it would be perfect. Would we need a power adapter too?   Ash will be sending out the address and the card information for processing shortly.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   Sure Mike, that would be great.

If mono, I have only a MC124MG-SY-UB camera available at the moment. You can make the ROI smaller to simulate the 5 Mpixel version as otherwise  these cameras are identical (same pixel size and operation). I have a 16mm lens that will cover the area the 5 Mpixel version would need, but it does not completely cover all 12 Mpixels, so you will see some dark edges when imaging with the whole focal plane.  If you want a color camera, I do have the 5 Mpixel version. Let me know what other accessories you’d like with the loan (a 3m USB cable is typical). I will need your complete contact information in including ship to address and phone number as well I’ll need  a credit card to back the loan.

Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517          [EXTERNAL]    Hi Vivek, I do have a 16mm lens that should cover our MC050MG camera. I’ll work with you to put a loan together when ready. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed insights. This sounds exciting.   Please find my answers inline in BLUE.     Kevin,   Nice to meet you. Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths for the distance you gave  me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can  deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:    What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging.What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:  The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width.The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches.Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches.Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face.The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens. Please let me know if you require any additional details.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Thank you, Mike. We'll confirm the FOV by early tomorrow.          To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --     Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517          [EXTERNAL]    (+ Kevin)   Hi Ash,   I am adding Kevin to the thread, as he is managing our camera loan program. I have to check what we can do about the strobe light.  We don’t typically sell those, so we don’t have them as loan items either. But I will check and let you know.   The items you would need for your test are:   MC023MG-SY-UB (this is a monochrome camera) We can add a zoom lens, but I need to know what the desired field of view is (i.e., the area that you can guarantee contains the  bar code). The focal length of the lens will depend on that size. A mounting bracket and a USB3 cable is not an issue. We should also have a trigger cable that you can use.   For the strobe light I have to wait until I hear back from the company that we end up getting them from.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Good morning and hope you had a great weekend.    Can you please send us the following camera, strobe, and associated peripherals for development / trial? If this works, this would convert into a 200+ camera deal to begin with and our footprint is massive on  the current account, and growing heavily across the industry on a number of use case.     Camera Model: MC023MG-SY-UB with proper Zoom lens that can allow us to focus on moving carton on conveyer from a distance of about 36 to 48 inches Associated Strobe light that can be simultaneously triggered (either through Ximea or your partner) Proper camera mount that we can use  Associated peripherals   Below is the shipping address:   Ashutosh Prasad AMLI QUADRANGLE  2717 Howell St  APT #4114 DALLAS, TEXAS 75204    Additionally, we would also like to understand a bit more about the Xray and Hyperspectral cameras Ximea offers.   Please let me know in case of any questions.    @Hemdeep Ray  – Can you please send Mike our MNDA for signature? It would be good to have a MNDA in place as we jointly target large deals.   --  Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   We don’t make GigE cameras, as most of our customers must rely on getting images as fast as possible, and Ethernet networks can be clogged by other applications.    Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed overview. What you have articulated below looks great to me. We will do an internal review and revert with questions if any.   For the current use case, we have the option to connect the camera either over USB or Ethernet. Do you also have cameras that relay videos over LAN instead of USB?      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517  Absolutely Mike, thanks a ton for this. I am also marking the rest of the team on this email so nobody misses anything.   Hi Ash, Vivek – Mike has provided some rough calculations based on the info we provided. Request you to take a look.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which  of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a  lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s)  with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when  the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to  see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx.  1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box.  You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400  x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000  x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need  multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel  (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.   Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Nano_Benchmarks     Loan cameras:   We do have some of these cameras available as loan cameras, but my colleague Kevin is managing the loan program. I will get him involved  if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the  card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson  (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can  also discuss that, if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

We are running against a tight timeline, and since we are not sure  about the right fit, it would be good to test both the camera systems at once. We can return one of these immediately after our tests which shouldn’t take longer than a few days. Additionally, may I request to ship the camera and lens as soon as possible while  we wait for the inputs on strobe light from Mike?   Thanks.      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hi Vivek, the 16mm lens I have will not cover the 12 Mpixel sensor very well. The lens is designed for a 2/3” sensor, and the 12 Mpixel sensor is 1.1”, so coverage at the edges will not be good. But, it would be adequate  if you made a ROI for the center 5 Mpixels. I do have one lens that will cover the entire 12 Mpixel sensor, but it is a 35mm lens and may be the wrong focal length for you. Let me know what you think of all this and if one configuration or the other sounds  better. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the prompt response. This is the last piece of puzzle we need to solve before we can present the solution out in front of the customer. To close this quickly and move to the production phase with them,  time is of essence and as such anything you could do to expedite the lighting setup would go a long way.   Kevin,   We want to try out the model “MC124MG-SY-UB” with a 16mm lens as you have suggested given the availability conditions. I am assuming the dark edges you are talking about will not cover more than 5% of the edges. Please  let me know if this is not the case. Additionally, a 3m USB cable to go with it would be perfect. Would we need a power adapter too?   Ash will be sending out the address and the card information for processing shortly.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   Sure Mike, that would be great.

If mono, I have only a MC124MG-SY-UB camera available at the moment. You can make the ROI smaller to simulate the 5 Mpixel version as otherwise  these cameras are identical (same pixel size and operation). I have a 16mm lens that will cover the area the 5 Mpixel version would need, but it does not completely cover all 12 Mpixels, so you will see some dark edges when imaging with the whole focal plane.  If you want a color camera, I do have the 5 Mpixel version. Let me know what other accessories you’d like with the loan (a 3m USB cable is typical). I will need your complete contact information in including ship to address and phone number as well I’ll need  a credit card to back the loan.

Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517          [EXTERNAL]    Hi Vivek, I do have a 16mm lens that should cover our MC050MG camera. I’ll work with you to put a loan together when ready. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed insights. This sounds exciting.   Please find my answers inline in  BLUE.     Kevin,   Nice to meet you. Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths for the distance you gave  me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can  deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:    What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging.What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:  The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width.The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches.Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches.Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face.The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens. Please let me know if you require any additional details.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Thank you, Mike. We'll confirm the FOV by early tomorrow.          To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --     Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517          [EXTERNAL]    (+ Kevin)   Hi Ash,   I am adding Kevin to the thread, as he is managing our camera loan program. I have to check what we can do about the strobe light.  We don’t typically sell those, so we don’t have them as loan items either. But I will check and let you know.   The items you would need for your test are:   MC023MG-SY-UB (this is a monochrome camera) We can add a zoom lens, but I need to know what the desired field of view is (i.e., the area that you can guarantee contains the bar  code). The focal length of the lens will depend on that size. A mounting bracket and a USB3 cable is not an issue. We should also have a trigger cable that you can use.   For the strobe light I have to wait until I hear back from the company that we end up getting them from.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Good morning and hope you had a great weekend.    Can you please send us the following camera, strobe, and associated peripherals for development / trial?

It would be good to have a MNDA in place as we jointly target large deals.   --  Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   We don’t make GigE cameras, as most of our customers must rely on getting images as fast as possible, and Ethernet networks can be clogged by other applications.    Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed overview. What you have articulated below looks great to me. We will do an internal review and revert with questions if any.   For the current use case, we have the option to connect the camera either over USB or Ethernet. Do you also have cameras that relay videos over LAN instead of USB?      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517  Absolutely Mike, thanks a ton for this. I am also marking the rest of the team on this email so nobody misses anything.   Hi Ash, Vivek – Mike has provided some rough calculations based on the info we provided. Request you to take a look.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which of  our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot  or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s) with  a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when the  box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse  (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to see what  is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx.  1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box.  You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x  1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000  x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need  multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel  (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.   Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Nano_Benchmarks     Loan cameras:   We do have some of these cameras available as loan cameras, but my colleague Kevin is managing the loan program. I will get him involved  if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the  card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson (if  you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can also  discuss that, if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

We are running against a tight timeline, and since we are not sure about the right fit, it would be good to test both the camera systems at once.  We can return one of these immediately after our tests which shouldn’t take longer than a few days. Additionally, may I request to ship the camera and lens as soon as possible while we wait for the inputs on strobe light from Mike?     Thanks.        --  Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517    [EXTERNAL]    Hi Vivek, the 16mm lens I have will not cover the 12 Mpixel sensor very well. The lens is designed for a 2/3” sensor, and the 12 Mpixel sensor is 1.1”, so coverage at the edges will not be good. But, it would be adequate if you  made a ROI for the center 5 Mpixels. I do have one lens that will cover the entire 12 Mpixel sensor, but it is a 35mm lens and may be the wrong focal length for you. Let me know what you think of all this and if one configuration or the other sounds better.  Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517       Mike,     Thank you for the prompt response. This is the last piece of puzzle we need to solve before we can present the solution out in front of the customer. To close this quickly and move to the production phase with them, time is of  essence and as such anything you could do to expedite the lighting setup would go a long way.     Kevin,     We want to try out the model “MC124MG-SY-UB” with a 16mm lens as you have suggested given the availability conditions. I am assuming the dark edges you are talking about will not cover more than 5% of the edges. Please let me  know if this is not the case. Additionally, a 3m USB cable to go with it would be perfect. Would we need a power adapter too?     Ash will be sending out the address and the card information for processing shortly.        --  Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517    Sure Mike, that would be great.

If mono, I have only a MC124MG-SY-UB camera available at the moment. You can make the ROI smaller to simulate the 5 Mpixel version as otherwise these cameras are identical (same  pixel size and operation). I have a 16mm lens that will cover the area the 5 Mpixel version would need, but it does not completely cover all 12 Mpixels, so you will see some dark edges when imaging with the whole focal plane. If you want a color camera, I  do have the 5 Mpixel version. Let me know what other accessories you’d like with the loan (a 3m USB cable is typical). I will need your complete contact information in including ship to address and phone number as well I’ll need a credit card to back the loan. Please fill out the attached form with your credit card information. Once completed, please send it via the Dropbox link below.

If you could provide us with a date, we could work towards it.       Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517           [EXTERNAL]     Hi Vivek, I do have a 16mm lens that should cover our MC050MG camera. I’ll work with you to put a loan together when ready.  Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517       Mike,     Thank you for the detailed insights. This sounds exciting.     Please find my answers inline in  BLUE.        Kevin,     Nice to meet you. Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?        --  Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517    [EXTERNAL]    Hello Vivek,     I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of the range you gave me).  Makes sense.     Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths for the distance you gave me: at 30” working  distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard.  Thank you.     The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can deal with it. A  correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement.  Our team should be able to take care of this.     I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.     I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:      What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?     So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner package together for you.     Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517       Mike,     We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.     I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens. Please let me know if you require any additional details.        --  Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517      Thank you, Mike. We'll confirm the FOV by early tomorrow.            To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/         --     Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517           [EXTERNAL]     (+ Kevin)     Hi Ash,     I am adding Kevin to the thread, as he is managing our camera loan program. I have to check what we can do about the strobe light. We don’t typically sell those, so we don’t have them as  loan items either. But I will check and let you know.     The items you would need for your test are:     MC023MG-SY-UB (this is a monochrome camera)  We can add a zoom lens, but I need to know what the desired field of view is (i.e., the area that you can guarantee contains the bar code). The focal length of the lens will depend on that  size.  A mounting bracket and a USB3 cable is not an issue. We should also have a trigger cable that you can use.     For the strobe light I have to wait until I hear back from the company that we end up getting them from.     Mike        Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517       Mike,     Good morning and hope you had a great weekend.       Can you please send us the following camera, strobe, and associated peripherals for development / trial? If this works, this would convert into a 200+ camera deal to begin with and our footprint is massive on the current account,  and growing heavily across the industry on a number of use case.      Camera Model: MC023MG-SY-UB with proper Zoom lens that can allow us to focus on moving carton on conveyer from a distance of about 36 to 48 inches Associated Strobe light that can be simultaneously triggered (either through Ximea or your partner) Proper camera mount that we can use  Associated peripherals     Below is the shipping address:     Ashutosh Prasad  AMLI QUADRANGLE   2717 Howell St   APT #4114  DALLAS, TEXAS 75204      Additionally, we would also like to understand a bit more about the Xray and Hyperspectral cameras Ximea offers.     Please let me know in case of any questions.      @Hemdeep Ray  – Can you please send Mike our MNDA for signature? It would be good to have a MNDA in place as we jointly target large deals.     --   Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517    [EXTERNAL]    Hello Vivek,     We don’t make GigE cameras, as most of our customers must rely on getting images as fast as possible, and Ethernet networks can be clogged by other applications.      Mike        Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517       Mike,     Thank you for the detailed overview. What you have articulated below looks great to me. We will do an internal review and revert with questions if any.     For the current use case, we have the option to connect the camera either over USB or Ethernet. Do you also have cameras that relay videos over LAN instead of USB?        --  Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   Absolutely Mike, thanks a ton for this. I am also marking the rest of the team on this email so nobody misses anything.     Hi Ash, Vivek – Mike has provided some rough calculations based on the info we provided. Request you to take a look.        Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517    [EXTERNAL]    Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.     Hello Gentlemen,     Thank you for talking to me yesterday.      I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which of our cameras could get you there.     Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.      In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot  light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.   The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s) with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.      I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that  triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite  simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to see what is needed there.     Geometry:     You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx. 1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture  that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box. You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet  area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).      4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the  side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000 x 2000.     This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.      Frame rate.      The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes  are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation  can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.      So, which camera should you use?     I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.     Using a  Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do have  the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:     TX2 carrier boards:  https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras  API information:   https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support  Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing  TX2 vs Xavier:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier  Nano benchmarks:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Nano_Benchmarks        Loan cameras:     We do have some of these cameras available as loan cameras, but my colleague Kevin is managing the loan program. I will get him involved if you want to try the camera to see if it works.  The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more  complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.     Further thought:     What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a  dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can also discuss that, if you want. We can design such an interface  board to your specifications.     I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.     Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517       Sorry.

Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Hi Vivek, I do have a 16mm lens that should cover our MC050MG camera. I’ll work with you to put a loan together when ready. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed insights. This sounds exciting.   Please find my answers inline in BLUE.     Kevin,   Nice to meet you. Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of the range  you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths  for the distance you gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or  if the bar code algorithm can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:    What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging.What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner package  together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:  The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width.The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches.Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches.Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on  its front face.The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens. Please let me know if you require any additional details.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Thank you, Mike. We'll confirm the FOV by early tomorrow.          To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --     Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    (+ Kevin)   Hi Ash,   I am adding Kevin to the thread, as he is managing our camera loan program. I have to check what we can do about the strobe light. We don’t typically  sell those, so we don’t have them as loan items either. But I will check and let you know.   The items you would need for your test are:   MC023MG-SY-UB (this is a monochrome camera) We can add a zoom lens, but I need to know what the desired field of view is (i.e., the area that you can guarantee contains the bar code). The focal  length of the lens will depend on that size. A mounting bracket and a USB3 cable is not an issue. We should also have a trigger cable that you can use.   For the strobe light I have to wait until I hear back from the company that we end up getting them from.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Good morning and hope you had a great weekend.    Can you please send us the following camera, strobe, and associated peripherals for development / trial? If this works, this would convert into a 200+ camera deal to begin with and  our footprint is massive on the current account, and growing heavily across the industry on a number of use case.    Camera Model: MC023MG-SY-UB with proper Zoom lens that can allow us to focus on moving carton on conveyer from a distance of about 36 to 48 inchesAssociated Strobe light that can be simultaneously triggered (either through Ximea or your partner)Proper camera mount that we can use Associated peripherals   Below is the shipping address:   Ashutosh Prasad AMLI QUADRANGLE  2717 Howell St  APT #4114 DALLAS, TEXAS 75204    Additionally, we would also like to understand a bit more about the Xray and Hyperspectral cameras Ximea offers.   Please let me know in case of any questions.    @Hemdeep  Ray – Can you please send Mike our MNDA for signature? It would be good to have a MNDA in place as we jointly target large deals.   --  Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   We don’t make GigE cameras, as most of our customers must rely on getting images as fast as possible, and Ethernet networks can be clogged by other applications.    Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed overview. What you have articulated below looks great to me. We will do an internal review and revert with questions if any.   For the current use case, we have the option to connect the camera either over USB or Ethernet. Do you also have cameras that relay videos over LAN instead of USB?      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517  Absolutely Mike, thanks a ton for this. I am also marking the rest of the team on this email so nobody misses anything.   Hi Ash, Vivek – Mike has provided some rough calculations based on the info we provided. Request you to take a look.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which of our cameras could  get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot or power. But It  might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s) with a short enough  pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when the box interrupts the  beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse (up to 24V). So,  the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx. 1.5 inches wide. Obviously,  you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box. You would need a camera that  can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x 1,800. The same calculation  applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need multiple images per  second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel (4000 x 3000) in the  (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.   Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Nano_Benchmarks     Loan cameras:   We do have some of these cameras available as loan cameras, but my colleague Kevin is managing the loan program. I will get him involved if you want to  try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the card if it comes  back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson (if you want to use  one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can also discuss that,  if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths  for the distance you gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if  the bar code algorithm can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:    What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging.What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely.

I am also marking the rest of the team on this email so nobody misses anything.   Hi Ash, Vivek – Mike has provided some rough calculations based on the info we provided. Request you to take a look.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which of our cameras could  get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot or power. But It  might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s) with a short enough pulse  of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when the box interrupts the  beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse (up to 24V). So,  the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx. 1.5 inches wide. Obviously,  you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box. You would need a camera that  can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x 1,800. The same calculation  applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need multiple images per  second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel (4000 x 3000) in the  (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.   Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Nano_Benchmarks     Loan cameras:   We do have some of these cameras available as loan cameras, but my colleague Kevin is managing the loan program. I will get him involved if you want to  try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the card if it comes  back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson (if you want to use one)  plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can also discuss that, if you  want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

We are running against a tight timeline, and since we are not sure about the right fit, it would be good to test both the  camera systems at once. We can return one of these immediately after our tests which shouldn’t take longer than a few days. Additionally, may I request to ship the camera and lens as soon as possible while we wait for the inputs on strobe light from Mike?   Thanks.      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hi Vivek, the 16mm lens I have will not cover the 12 Mpixel sensor very well. The lens is designed for a 2/3” sensor, and the 12 Mpixel sensor is 1.1”, so coverage at the edges will not be good. But, it would  be adequate if you made a ROI for the center 5 Mpixels. I do have one lens that will cover the entire 12 Mpixel sensor, but it is a 35mm lens and may be the wrong focal length for you. Let me know what you think of all this and if one configuration or the  other sounds better. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the prompt response. This is the last piece of puzzle we need to solve before we can present the solution out in front of the customer. To close this quickly and move to the production phase  with them, time is of essence and as such anything you could do to expedite the lighting setup would go a long way.   Kevin,   We want to try out the model “MC124MG-SY-UB” with a 16mm lens as you have suggested given the availability conditions. I am assuming the dark edges you are talking about will not cover more than 5% of the  edges. Please let me know if this is not the case. Additionally, a 3m USB cable to go with it would be perfect. Would we need a power adapter too?   Ash will be sending out the address and the card information for processing shortly.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   Sure Mike, that would be great.

If mono, I have only a MC124MG-SY-UB camera available at the moment. You can make the ROI smaller to simulate the  5 Mpixel version as otherwise these cameras are identical (same pixel size and operation). I have a 16mm lens that will cover the area the 5 Mpixel version would need, but it does not completely cover all 12 Mpixels, so you will see some dark edges when imaging  with the whole focal plane. If you want a color camera, I do have the 5 Mpixel version. Let me know what other accessories you’d like with the loan (a 3m USB cable is typical).

I am also marking the rest of the team on this email so nobody misses anything.   Hi Ash, Vivek – Mike has provided some rough calculations based on the info we provided. Request you to take a look.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which of our cameras could get  you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot or power. But It might  be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s) with a short enough pulse  of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when the box interrupts the beam,  a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger  could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx. 1.5 inches wide. Obviously,  you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box. You would need a camera that  can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x 1,800. The same calculation  applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need multiple images per second  (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively  slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.   Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Nano_Benchmarks     Loan cameras:   We do have some of these cameras available as loan cameras, but my colleague Kevin is managing the loan program. I will get him involved if you want to try  the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the card if it comes  back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson (if you want to use one)  plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can also discuss that, if you  want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

We are running against a tight timeline, and since we are not sure about the right fit, it would be good to test both the  camera systems at once. We can return one of these immediately after our tests which shouldn’t take longer than a few days. Additionally, may I request to ship the camera and lens as soon as possible while we wait for the inputs on strobe light from Mike?   Thanks.      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hi Vivek, the 16mm lens I have will not cover the 12 Mpixel sensor very well. The lens is designed for a 2/3” sensor, and the 12 Mpixel sensor is 1.1”, so coverage at the edges will not be good. But, it would  be adequate if you made a ROI for the center 5 Mpixels. I do have one lens that will cover the entire 12 Mpixel sensor, but it is a 35mm lens and may be the wrong focal length for you. Let me know what you think of all this and if one configuration or the  other sounds better. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the prompt response. This is the last piece of puzzle we need to solve before we can present the solution out in front of the customer. To close this quickly and move to the production phase  with them, time is of essence and as such anything you could do to expedite the lighting setup would go a long way.   Kevin,   We want to try out the model “MC124MG-SY-UB” with a 16mm lens as you have suggested given the availability conditions. I am assuming the dark edges you are talking about will not cover more than 5% of the  edges. Please let me know if this is not the case. Additionally, a 3m USB cable to go with it would be perfect. Would we need a power adapter too?   Ash will be sending out the address and the card information for processing shortly.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   Sure Mike, that would be great.

If mono, I have only a MC124MG-SY-UB camera available at the moment. You can make the ROI smaller to simulate the  5 Mpixel version as otherwise these cameras are identical (same pixel size and operation). I have a 16mm lens that will cover the area the 5 Mpixel version would need, but it does not completely cover all 12 Mpixels, so you will see some dark edges when imaging  with the whole focal plane. If you want a color camera, I do have the 5 Mpixel version. Let me know what other accessories you’d like with the loan (a 3m USB cable is typical). I will need your complete contact information in including ship to address and  phone number as well I’ll need a credit card to back the loan.

Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Hi Vivek, I do have a 16mm lens that should cover our MC050MG camera. I’ll work with you to put a loan together when ready. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed insights. This sounds exciting.   Please find my answers inline in BLUE.     Kevin,   Nice to meet you. Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of the range you  gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths  for the distance you gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if  the bar code algorithm can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner package  together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens. Please let me know if you require any additional details.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Thank you, Mike. We'll confirm the FOV by early tomorrow.          To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --     Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    (+ Kevin)   Hi Ash,   I am adding Kevin to the thread, as he is managing our camera loan program. I have to check what we can do about the strobe light. We don’t typically sell  those, so we don’t have them as loan items either. But I will check and let you know.   The items you would need for your test are:   MC023MG-SY-UB (this is a monochrome camera) We can add a zoom lens, but I need to know what the desired field of view is (i.e., the area that you can guarantee contains the bar code). The focal length  of the lens will depend on that size. A mounting bracket and a USB3 cable is not an issue. We should also have a trigger cable that you can use.   For the strobe light I have to wait until I hear back from the company that we end up getting them from.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Good morning and hope you had a great weekend.    Can you please send us the following camera, strobe, and associated peripherals for development / trial?

If mono, I have only a MC124MG-SY-UB camera available at the moment. You can make the ROI smaller to simulate the  5 Mpixel version as otherwise these cameras are identical (same pixel size and operation). I have a 16mm lens that will cover the area the 5 Mpixel version would need, but it does not completely cover all 12 Mpixels, so you will see some dark edges when imaging  with the whole focal plane. If you want a color camera, I do have the 5 Mpixel version. Let me know what other accessories you’d like with the loan (a 3m USB cable is typical). I will need your complete contact information in including ship to address and  phone number as well I’ll need a credit card to back the loan. Please fill out the attached form with your credit card information. Once completed, please send it via the Dropbox link below.

If you could provide us with a date, we could work towards it.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Hi Vivek, I do have a 16mm lens that should cover our MC050MG camera. I’ll work with you to put a loan together when ready. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed insights. This sounds exciting.   Please find my answers inline in BLUE.     Kevin,   Nice to meet you. Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of the range you  gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths  for the distance you gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if  the bar code algorithm can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner package  together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens. Please let me know if you require any additional details.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Thank you, Mike. We'll confirm the FOV by early tomorrow.          To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --     Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    (+ Kevin)   Hi Ash,   I am adding Kevin to the thread, as he is managing our camera loan program. I have to check what we can do about the strobe light. We don’t typically sell  those, so we don’t have them as loan items either. But I will check and let you know.   The items you would need for your test are:   MC023MG-SY-UB (this is a monochrome camera) We can add a zoom lens, but I need to know what the desired field of view is (i.e., the area that you can guarantee contains the bar code). The focal length  of the lens will depend on that size. A mounting bracket and a USB3 cable is not an issue. We should also have a trigger cable that you can use.   For the strobe light I have to wait until I hear back from the company that we end up getting them from.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Good morning and hope you had a great weekend.    Can you please send us the following camera, strobe, and associated peripherals for development / trial? If this works, this would convert into a 200+ camera deal to begin with and our  footprint is massive on the current account, and growing heavily across the industry on a number of use case.     Camera Model: MC023MG-SY-UB with proper Zoom lens that can allow us to focus on moving carton on conveyer from a distance of about 36 to 48 inches Associated Strobe light that can be simultaneously triggered (either through Ximea or your partner) Proper camera mount that we can use  Associated peripherals   Below is the shipping address:   Ashutosh Prasad AMLI QUADRANGLE  2717 Howell St  APT #4114 DALLAS, TEXAS 75204    Additionally, we would also like to understand a bit more about the Xray and Hyperspectral cameras Ximea offers.   Please let me know in case of any questions.    @Hemdeep Ray  – Can you please send Mike our MNDA for signature? It would be good to have a MNDA in place as we jointly target large deals.   --  Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   We don’t make GigE cameras, as most of our customers must rely on getting images as fast as possible, and Ethernet networks can be clogged by other applications.    Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed overview. What you have articulated below looks great to me. We will do an internal review and revert with questions if any.   For the current use case, we have the option to connect the camera either over USB or Ethernet. Do you also have cameras that relay videos over LAN instead of USB?      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517  Absolutely Mike, thanks a ton for this. I am also marking the rest of the team on this email so nobody misses anything.   Hi Ash, Vivek – Mike has provided some rough calculations based on the info we provided. Request you to take a look.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which of our cameras could get  you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot or power. But It might  be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s) with a short enough pulse  of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when the box interrupts the beam,  a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger  could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx. 1.5 inches wide. Obviously,  you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box. You would need a camera that  can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x 1,800. The same calculation  applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need multiple images per second  (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively  slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.   Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Nano_Benchmarks     Loan cameras:   We do have some of these cameras available as loan cameras, but my colleague Kevin is managing the loan program. I will get him involved if you want to try  the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the card if it comes  back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson (if you want to use one)  plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can also discuss that, if you  want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm.

These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if  the bar code algorithm can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely.

I am also marking the rest of the team on this email so nobody misses anything.   Hi Ash, Vivek – Mike has provided some rough calculations based on the info we provided. Request you to take a look.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which of our cameras could get  you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot or power. But It might  be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s) with a short enough pulse  of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when the box interrupts the beam,  a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger  could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx. 1.5 inches wide. Obviously,  you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box. You would need a camera that  can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x 1,800. The same calculation  applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need multiple images per second  (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively  slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.   Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Nano_Benchmarks     Loan cameras:   We do have some of these cameras available as loan cameras, but my colleague Kevin is managing the loan program. I will get him involved if you want to try  the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the card if it comes  back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson (if you want to use one)  plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can also discuss that, if you  want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

Request you to take a look.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which  of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use  a lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s)  with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and  when the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage  pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to  see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx.  1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box.  You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400  x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000  x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will  need multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel  (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.   Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Nano_Benchmarks     Loan cameras:   We do have some of these cameras available as loan cameras, but my colleague Kevin is managing the loan program. I will get him  involved if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges  on the card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson  (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can  also discuss that, if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

"Hi Vivek, the 16mm lens I have will not cover the 12 Mpixel sensor very well. The lens is designed for a 2/3” sensor, and the 12 Mpixel sensor is 1.1”, so coverage at the edges will not be good. But, it would be adequate if you made a ROI  for the center 5 Mpixels. I do have one lens that will cover the entire 12 Mpixel sensor, but it is a 35mm lens and may be the wrong focal length for you. Let me know what you think of all this and if one configuration or the other sounds better. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the prompt response. This is the last piece of puzzle we need to solve before we can present the solution out in front of the customer. To close this quickly and move to the production phase with them, time is of essence and  as such anything you could do to expedite the lighting setup would go a long way.   Kevin,   We want to try out the model “MC124MG-SY-UB” with a 16mm lens as you have suggested given the availability conditions. I am assuming the dark edges you are talking about will not cover more than 5% of the edges. Please let me know if this  is not the case. Additionally, a 3m USB cable to go with it would be perfect. Would we need a power adapter too?   Ash will be sending out the address and the card information for processing shortly.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   Sure Mike, that would be great.

If mono, I have only a MC124MG-SY-UB camera available at the moment. You can make the ROI smaller to simulate the 5 Mpixel version as otherwise  these cameras are identical (same pixel size and operation). I have a 16mm lens that will cover the area the 5 Mpixel version would need, but it does not completely cover all 12 Mpixels, so you will see some dark edges when imaging with the whole focal plane.  If you want a color camera, I do have the 5 Mpixel version. Let me know what other accessories you’d like with the loan (a 3m USB cable is typical). I will need your complete contact information in including ship to address and phone number as well I’ll need  a credit card to back the loan. Please fill out the attached form with your credit card information. Once completed, please send it via the Dropbox link below. You may call me at 303-389-9838 x210 if you prefer.   https://www.dropbox.com/request/rWULiT1x0jP2bZCElJwI    Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517      Hi Kevin,   Do let us know when the loan camera with the lens will be ready for delivery. If you could provide us with a date, we could work towards it.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Hi Vivek, I do have a 16mm lens that should cover our MC050MG camera. I’ll work with you to put a loan together when ready. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed insights. This sounds exciting.   Please find my answers inline in  BLUE.     Kevin,   Nice to meet you. Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths for the distance you gave me:  at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can deal  with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens. Please let me know if you require any additional details.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Thank you, Mike. We'll confirm the FOV by early tomorrow.          To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    (+ Kevin)   Hi Ash,   I am adding Kevin to the thread, as he is managing our camera loan program. I have to check what we can do about the strobe light. We don’t  typically sell those, so we don’t have them as loan items either. But I will check and let you know.   The items you would need for your test are:   MC023MG-SY-UB (this is a monochrome camera) We can add a zoom lens, but I need to know what the desired field of view is (i.e., the area that you can guarantee contains the bar code).  The focal length of the lens will depend on that size. A mounting bracket and a USB3 cable is not an issue. We should also have a trigger cable that you can use.   For the strobe light I have to wait until I hear back from the company that we end up getting them from.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Good morning and hope you had a great weekend.    Can you please send us the following camera, strobe, and associated peripherals for development / trial?

"Mike,   Thank you for the prompt response. This is the last piece of puzzle we need to solve before we can present the solution out in front of the customer. To close this quickly and move to the production phase with them, time is of essence and  as such anything you could do to expedite the lighting setup would go a long way.   Kevin,   We want to try out the model “MC124MG-SY-UB” with a 16mm lens as you have suggested given the availability conditions. I am assuming the dark edges you are talking about will not cover more than 5% of the edges. Please let me know if this  is not the case. Additionally, a 3m USB cable to go with it would be perfect.

If mono, I have only a MC124MG-SY-UB camera available at the moment. You can make the ROI smaller to simulate the 5 Mpixel version as otherwise  these cameras are identical (same pixel size and operation). I have a 16mm lens that will cover the area the 5 Mpixel version would need, but it does not completely cover all 12 Mpixels, so you will see some dark edges when imaging with the whole focal plane.  If you want a color camera, I do have the 5 Mpixel version. Let me know what other accessories you’d like with the loan (a 3m USB cable is typical). I will need your complete contact information in including ship to address and phone number as well I’ll need  a credit card to back the loan.

Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    Hi Vivek, I do have a 16mm lens that should cover our MC050MG camera. I’ll work with you to put a loan together when ready. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed insights. This sounds exciting.   Please find my answers inline in  BLUE.     Kevin,   Nice to meet you. Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths for the distance you gave me:  at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can deal  with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:     What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens. Please let me know if you require any additional details.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Thank you, Mike. We'll confirm the FOV by early tomorrow.          To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/       --    Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517         [EXTERNAL]    (+ Kevin)   Hi Ash,   I am adding Kevin to the thread, as he is managing our camera loan program. I have to check what we can do about the strobe light. We don’t  typically sell those, so we don’t have them as loan items either. But I will check and let you know.   The items you would need for your test are:   MC023MG-SY-UB (this is a monochrome camera) We can add a zoom lens, but I need to know what the desired field of view is (i.e., the area that you can guarantee contains the bar code).  The focal length of the lens will depend on that size. A mounting bracket and a USB3 cable is not an issue. We should also have a trigger cable that you can use.   For the strobe light I have to wait until I hear back from the company that we end up getting them from.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Good morning and hope you had a great weekend.    Can you please send us the following camera, strobe, and associated peripherals for development / trial? If this works, this would convert into a 200+ camera deal to begin with and our footprint is massive on the  current account, and growing heavily across the industry on a number of use case.     Camera Model: MC023MG-SY-UB with proper Zoom lens that can allow us to focus on moving carton on conveyer from a distance of about 36 to 48 inches Associated Strobe light that can be simultaneously triggered (either through Ximea or your partner) Proper camera mount that we can use  Associated peripherals   Below is the shipping address:   Ashutosh Prasad AMLI QUADRANGLE  2717 Howell St  APT #4114 DALLAS, TEXAS 75204    Additionally, we would also like to understand a bit more about the Xray and Hyperspectral cameras Ximea offers.   Please let me know in case of any questions.    @Hemdeep Ray  – Can you please send Mike our MNDA for signature? It would be good to have a MNDA in place as we jointly target large deals.   --  Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   We don’t make GigE cameras, as most of our customers must rely on getting images as fast as possible, and Ethernet networks can be clogged by other applications.    Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed overview. What you have articulated below looks great to me. We will do an internal review and revert with questions if any.   For the current use case, we have the option to connect the camera either over USB or Ethernet. Do you also have cameras that relay videos over LAN instead of USB?      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517  Absolutely Mike, thanks a ton for this. I am also marking the rest of the team on this email so nobody misses anything.   Hi Ash, Vivek – Mike has provided some rough calculations based on the info we provided. Request you to take a look.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which of our  cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot or  power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s) with a  short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when the box  interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse (up  to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to see what is  needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx. 1.5 inches  wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box. You would  need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x 1,800.  The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need multiple  images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel (4000 x 3000)  in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.   Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Nano_Benchmarks     Loan cameras:   We do have some of these cameras available as loan cameras, but my colleague Kevin is managing the loan program. I will get him involved  if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the  card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson (if you  want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can also discuss  that, if you want.

This sounds exciting.   Please find my answers inline in  BLUE.     Kevin,   Nice to meet you. Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths for the distance you gave me:  at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can deal  with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:    What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging.What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:  The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches.

I am also marking the rest of the team on this email so nobody misses anything.   Hi Ash, Vivek – Mike has provided some rough calculations based on the info we provided. Request you to take a look.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which of our  cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot  or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s) with  a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when the  box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse  (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to see what  is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx. 1.5  inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box. You  would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x 1,800.  The same calculation applies to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need multiple  images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel (4000 x 3000)  in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.   Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Nano_Benchmarks     Loan cameras:   We do have some of these cameras available as loan cameras, but my colleague Kevin is managing the loan program. I will get him involved  if you want to try the camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the  card if it comes back undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson (if  you want to use one) plus the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can also  discuss that, if you want. We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

If mono, I have only a MC124MG-SY-UB camera available at the moment. You can make the ROI smaller to simulate the 5 Mpixel version as otherwise these cameras are identical (same pixel size and operation). I  have a 16mm lens that will cover the area the 5 Mpixel version would need, but it does not completely cover all 12 Mpixels, so you will see some dark edges when imaging with the whole focal plane. If you want a color camera, I do have the 5 Mpixel version.  Let me know what other accessories you’d like with the loan (a 3m USB cable is typical). I will need your complete contact information in including ship to address and phone number as well I’ll need a credit card to back the loan.

If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000 x 2000.     This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.      Frame rate.       The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need multiple images per second (for example, if the boxes are 2  feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation can  go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.      So, which camera should you use?     I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.     Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images.  The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations,  check here:     TX2 carrier boards:  https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras  API information:   https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support  Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing  TX2 vs Xavier:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier  Nano benchmarks:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Nano_Benchmarks        Loan cameras:     We do have some of these cameras available as loan cameras, but my colleague Kevin is managing the loan program.

"Hi Kevin,   @Ashutosh Prasad has his boots on the ground so either him or @Vivek Prasad will respond to your query soon.   Best, Hemdeep   Get  Outlook for Android    RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517    [EXTERNAL]    Hi Aman, do you want a monochrome camera or color? If mono, I have only a MC124MG-SY-UB camera available at the moment. You can make the ROI smaller to simulate the 5 Mpixel version as otherwise these cameras are identical (same pixel size and operation). I  have a 16mm lens that will cover the area the 5 Mpixel version would need, but it does not completely cover all 12 Mpixels, so you will see some dark edges when imaging with the whole focal plane. If you want a color camera, I do have the 5 Mpixel version.  Let me know what other accessories you’d like with the loan (a 3m USB cable is typical). I will need your complete contact information in including ship to address and phone number as well I’ll need a credit card to back the loan. Please fill out the attached form with your credit card information. Once completed, please send it via the Dropbox link below. You may call me at 303-389-9838 x210 if you prefer.     https://www.dropbox.com/request/rWULiT1x0jP2bZCElJwI      Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517        Hi Kevin,   Do let us know when the loan camera with the lens will be ready for delivery. If you could provide us with a date, we could work towards it.       Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517           [EXTERNAL]     Hi Vivek, I do have a 16mm lens that should cover our MC050MG camera. I’ll work with you to put a loan together when ready.  Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517       Mike,     Thank you for the detailed insights. This sounds exciting.     Please find my answers inline in  BLUE.        Kevin,     Nice to meet you. Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?        --  Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517    [EXTERNAL]    Hello Vivek,     I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of the range you gave me).  Makes sense.     Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths for the distance you gave me: at 30” working  distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard.  Thank you.     The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if the bar code algorithm can deal with it. A  correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement.  Our team should be able to take care of this.     I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.     I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:      What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging. What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?     So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner package together for you.     Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517       Mike,     We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:   The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width. The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches. Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches. Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on its front face. The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.     I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens. Please let me know if you require any additional details.        --  Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517      Thank you, Mike. We'll confirm the FOV by early tomorrow.            To book a meeting: https://calendly.com/koireader/         --     Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517           [EXTERNAL]     (+ Kevin)     Hi Ash,     I am adding Kevin to the thread, as he is managing our camera loan program. I have to check what we can do about the strobe light. We don’t typically sell those, so we don’t have them as  loan items either. But I will check and let you know.     The items you would need for your test are:     MC023MG-SY-UB (this is a monochrome camera)  We can add a zoom lens, but I need to know what the desired field of view is (i.e., the area that you can guarantee contains the bar code). The focal length of the lens will depend on that  size.  A mounting bracket and a USB3 cable is not an issue. We should also have a trigger cable that you can use.     For the strobe light I have to wait until I hear back from the company that we end up getting them from.     Mike        Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517       Mike,     Good morning and hope you had a great weekend.       Can you please send us the following camera, strobe, and associated peripherals for development / trial? If this works, this would convert into a 200+ camera deal to begin with and our footprint is massive on the current account,  and growing heavily across the industry on a number of use case.      Camera Model: MC023MG-SY-UB with proper Zoom lens that can allow us to focus on moving carton on conveyer from a distance of about 36 to 48 inches Associated Strobe light that can be simultaneously triggered (either through Ximea or your partner) Proper camera mount that we can use  Associated peripherals     Below is the shipping address:     Ashutosh Prasad  AMLI QUADRANGLE   2717 Howell St   APT #4114  DALLAS, TEXAS 75204      Additionally, we would also like to understand a bit more about the Xray and Hyperspectral cameras Ximea offers.     Please let me know in case of any questions.      @Hemdeep Ray  – Can you please send Mike our MNDA for signature? It would be good to have a MNDA in place as we jointly target large deals.     --   Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517    [EXTERNAL]    Hello Vivek,     We don’t make GigE cameras, as most of our customers must rely on getting images as fast as possible, and Ethernet networks can be clogged by other applications.      Mike        Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517       Mike,     Thank you for the detailed overview. What you have articulated below looks great to me. We will do an internal review and revert with questions if any.     For the current use case, we have the option to connect the camera either over USB or Ethernet. Do you also have cameras that relay videos over LAN instead of USB?        --  Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   Absolutely Mike, thanks a ton for this. I am also marking the rest of the team on this email so nobody misses anything.     Hi Ash, Vivek – Mike has provided some rough calculations based on the info we provided. Request you to take a look.        Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517    [EXTERNAL]    Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.     Hello Gentlemen,     Thank you for talking to me yesterday.      I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which of our cameras could get you there.     Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.      In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use a spot  light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.   The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s) with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the motion.      I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated that  triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated quite  simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to see what is needed there.     Geometry:     You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx. 1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take a picture  that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box. You would need a camera that can image the 4x3 feet  area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).      4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera on the  side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000 x 2000.     This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.      Frame rate.      The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec.

That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3 implementation  can go up to 30 fps.

The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do have  the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode.

If you want  a color camera, I do have the 5 Mpixel version. Let me know what other accessories you’d like with the loan (a 3m USB cable is typical). I will need your complete contact information in including ship to address and phone number as well I’ll need a credit  card to back the loan.

This sounds exciting.   Please find my answers inline in BLUE.     Kevin,   Nice to meet you. Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths for the distance you  gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if the bar code algorithm  can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:    What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging.What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:  The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width.The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches.Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches.Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on  its front face.The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens. Please let me know if you require any additional details.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Thank you, Mike.

But I will check and let you know.   The items you would need for your test are:   MC023MG-SY-UB (this is a monochrome camera) We can add a zoom lens, but I need to know what the desired field of view is (i.e., the area that you can guarantee contains the bar code). The focal length of the lens will depend  on that size. A mounting bracket and a USB3 cable is not an issue. We should also have a trigger cable that you can use.   For the strobe light I have to wait until I hear back from the company that we end up getting them from.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Good morning and hope you had a great weekend.    Can you please send us the following camera, strobe, and associated peripherals for development / trial?

I am also marking the rest of the team on this email so nobody misses anything.   Hi Ash, Vivek – Mike has provided some rough calculations based on the info we provided. Request you to take a look.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot or power. But It might be worth a try to  use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s) with a short enough pulse of light to freeze  the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated  that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated  quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx. 1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take  a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box. You would need a camera that can image the  4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).     4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera  on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need multiple images per second (for example, if  the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3  implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.   Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Nano_Benchmarks     Loan cameras:   We do have some of these cameras available as loan cameras, but my colleague Kevin is managing the loan program. I will get him involved if you want to try the camera to see if  it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the card if it comes back undamaged. Things  get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson (if you want to use one) plus the camera and  lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can also discuss that, if you want. We can design  such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Nano_Benchmarks     Loan cameras:   We do have some of these cameras available as loan cameras, but my colleague Kevin is managing the loan program. I will get him involved if you want to try the camera to see  if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward.

Things  get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson (if you want to use one) plus the camera and  lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can also discuss that, if you want. We can design  such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

"Thanks for the confirmation, Kevin. We only need the lighting setup now to move ahead. Look forward to the next steps.      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hi Vivek, I do have a 16mm lens that should cover our MC050MG camera. I’ll work with you to put a loan together when ready. Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed insights. This sounds exciting.   Please find my answers inline in BLUE.     Kevin,   Nice to meet you. Would you know what lenses can be made available based on Mike’s suggestions?      -- Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   I calculated the lens for the parameters you gave me: field of view 24 x 18 inches, camera 24” above the belt and 37 inches away from the front side of the box (middle of the range you gave me). Makes sense.   Assuming that we are still talking about the 5 MPix camera that I had suggested (MC050MG-SY), the optimal lens would have a focal length of 13 mm. ( to give you a range of focal lengths for the distance you  gave me: at 30” working distance, you would need a 10mm lens, at 45mm WD the lens would have to be 16 mm. These lenses are fairly standard. Thank you.   The slightly oblique angle of the camera to the front surface would result in a slightly distorted image, and you would have to test if that requires a correction of the image, or if the bar code algorithm  can deal with it. A correction would have fixed parameters, so it would be easy to implement. Our team should be able to take care of this.   I am not quite sure what lenses we have that we could loan you. Kevin will know.   I have talked to a manufacturer of lighting products, and am waiting for a response as to what they can provide. They had a few questions for me:    What material is used for the bar codes? Is it matte or specular-reflective? The label on which barcodes are printed appear matte but there are scenarios when these labels are pasted on a reflective plastic packaging.What color are the bar codes? Always black on white, or are there different colors? Barcodes can be colored too. We have noticed green, red, pink, and yellow colors till now and there may be more variations. Are there any environmental or IP ratings we need to meet? It is always good to have at least IP65 rating on the devices, especially when we get to production. Will we be able to comply, or do you see any difficulties here?   So, I think this is progressing quite nicely. Once I hear back from the lighting manufacturer (for which I would need your input on the items above), I think we can put a loaner package together for you.   Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   We were unable to arrive at the exact field of view, however, here are a few measurements that may help us estimate the same:  The width of the conveyor belt is 18.5 inches. We may assume the front face of the cartons to be less than 18 inches in width.The height of the largest carton stretches up to 24 inches.Vertical distance between the conveyor belt and the camera will be 24 inches.Diagonal distance between the camera and the center of the carton is in the range of 30-40 inches. The label on the carton can be located anywhere on  its front face.The size of a typical barcode on a carton label varies between 2-5 inches.   I am not sure if the above is enough information for you to recommend a lens. Please let me know if you require any additional details.      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Thank you, Mike.

I have to check what we can do about the strobe light. We don’t typically sell those, so we don’t have  them as loan items either. But I will check and let you know.   The items you would need for your test are:   MC023MG-SY-UB (this is a monochrome camera) We can add a zoom lens, but I need to know what the desired field of view is (i.e., the area that you can guarantee contains the bar code). The focal length of the lens will depend  on that size. A mounting bracket and a USB3 cable is not an issue. We should also have a trigger cable that you can use.   For the strobe light I have to wait until I hear back from the company that we end up getting them from.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Good morning and hope you had a great weekend.    Can you please send us the following camera, strobe, and associated peripherals for development / trial? If this works, this would convert into a 200+ camera deal to begin with and our footprint is massive  on the current account, and growing heavily across the industry on a number of use case.    Camera Model: MC023MG-SY-UB with proper Zoom lens that can allow us to focus on moving carton on conveyer from a distance of about 36 to 48 inchesAssociated Strobe light that can be simultaneously triggered (either through Ximea or your partner)Proper camera mount that we can use Associated peripherals   Below is the shipping address:   Ashutosh Prasad AMLI QUADRANGLE  2717 Howell St  APT #4114 DALLAS, TEXAS 75204    Additionally, we would also like to understand a bit more about the Xray and Hyperspectral cameras Ximea offers.   Please let me know in case of any questions.    @Hemdeep Ray  – Can you please send Mike our MNDA for signature? It would be good to have a MNDA in place as we jointly target large deals.   --  Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Vivek,   We don’t make GigE cameras, as most of our customers must rely on getting images as fast as possible, and Ethernet networks can be clogged by other applications.    Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Thank you for the detailed overview.

I am also marking the rest of the team on this email so nobody misses anything.   Hi Ash, Vivek – Mike has provided some rough calculations based on the info we provided. Request you to take a look.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use  a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s) with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the  motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated  that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated  quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx. 1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take  a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box. You would need a camera that can image the  4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).     4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera  on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need multiple images per second (for example, if  the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3  implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.   Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode.

Request you to take a look.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use  a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s) with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the  motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated  that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated  quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx. 1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take  a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box. You would need a camera that can image the  4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).     4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera  on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need multiple images per second (for example, if  the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3  implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.   Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Nano_Benchmarks     Loan cameras:   We do have some of these cameras available as loan cameras, but my colleague Kevin is managing the loan program. I will get him involved if you want to try the camera to see if  it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the card if it comes back undamaged. Things  get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens  into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can also discuss that, if you want. We can design such  an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

I have to check what we can do about the strobe light. We don’t typically sell those, so we don’t have  them as loan items either. But I will check and let you know.   The items you would need for your test are:   MC023MG-SY-UB (this is a monochrome camera) We can add a zoom lens, but I need to know what the desired field of view is (i.e., the area that you can guarantee contains the bar code). The focal length of the lens will depend  on that size. A mounting bracket and a USB3 cable is not an issue. We should also have a trigger cable that you can use.   For the strobe light I have to wait until I hear back from the company that we end up getting them from.   Mike      Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Mike,   Good morning and hope you had a great weekend.    Can you please send us the following camera, strobe, and associated peripherals for development / trial?

I am also marking the rest of the team on this email so nobody misses anything.   Hi Ash, Vivek – Mike has provided some rough calculations based on the info we provided. Request you to take a look.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot or power. But It might be worth a try to use  a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s) with a short enough pulse of light to freeze the  motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated  that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated  quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx. 1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take  a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box. You would need a camera that can image the  4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).     4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the camera  on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need multiple images per second (for example, if  the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3  implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.   Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Nano_Benchmarks     Loan cameras:   We do have some of these cameras available as loan cameras, but my colleague Kevin is managing the loan program. I will get him involved if you want to try the camera to see if  it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the card if it comes back undamaged. Things  get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson (if you want to use one) plus the camera and lens  into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can also discuss that, if you want. We can design such  an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

Do you also have cameras that relay videos over LAN instead of USB?      -- Best Regards Re: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517  Absolutely Mike, thanks a ton for this. I am also marking the rest of the team on this email so nobody misses anything.   Hi Ash, Vivek – Mike has provided some rough calculations based on the info we provided. Request you to take a look.      Best Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517   [EXTERNAL]   Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot or power. But It might be worth  a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s) with a short enough pulse of light  to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when the box interrupts the beam, a signal  is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could  be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx. 1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you  need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box. You would need a camera that  can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x 1,800. The same calculation applies  to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need multiple images per second (for  example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively  slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.   Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Nano_Benchmarks     Loan cameras:   We do have some of these cameras available as loan cameras, but my colleague Kevin is managing the loan program. I will get him involved if you want to try the camera  to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the card if it comes back undamaged.  Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson (if you want to use one) plus the  camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can also discuss that, if you want. We  can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.

The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s) with a short enough pulse of light to freeze  the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when the box interrupts the beam, a signal is generated  that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger could be generated  quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx. 1.5 inches wide. Obviously, you need to take  a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box. You would need a camera that can image the  4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).     4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x 1,800. The same calculation applies to the  camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need multiple images per second (for example, if  the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively slow) USB3  implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.   Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards: https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks: https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Nano_Benchmarks     Loan cameras:   We do have some of these cameras available as loan cameras, but my colleague Kevin is managing the loan program. I will get him involved if you want to try the camera to see  if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the card if it comes back undamaged. Things  get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson (if you want to use one) plus the camera and  lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson.

Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot or power. But It might be worth  a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.

"Hello Hemdeep, would you be so kind to forward this to the other people that were present at our call? Thank you.   Hello Gentlemen,   Thank you for talking to me yesterday.    I promised I would make a back-of-the-envelope calculation to see what you would need in terms cameras and lighting and see which of our cameras could get you there.   Let’s start with the motion blur. You had mentioned that the conveyor belt moves at 5-8 miles/hour. Assuming the fastest option, this calculates to about 3.6 m/sec. The bar codes on your boxes consist of lines (I am assuming you use a standard bar code such as Code39 or  CODABAR), where each character is encoded in a sequence of wide and narrow bars and spaces. I will assume that we need a resolution of 500 um to resolve the bar code. To keep motion blur to a minimum, you would need an exposure time of 1/7500 seconds, or about  138 usec (=500 um/3600 mm/sec). That’s not too hard to do for a good camera, actually we have some cameras that go down to single digit usec exposure time. However, the short exposure time lets in only very little light, so you would need a strong light source.    In principle you could do this with a steady state light source, but that may be undesirable, as they can get very hot, and use a lot or power. But It might be  worth a try to use a spot light to illuminate the area where the bar code is expected and see if you can use a very short exposure time to freeze the motion blur.  The other option is of course to leave the camera at a longer exposure time but use a strobe light to illuminate the bar codes(s) with a short enough pulse of light  to freeze the motion.    I do think that you will need to time the acquisition. The way to do that would be to have a light gate across the belt, and when the box interrupts the beam, a  signal is generated that triggers the camera (in the steady state illumination model) or triggers the camera and strobe light in an appropriate manner to get the image. The cameras can be set up to respond to a simple voltage pulse (up to 24V). So, the trigger  could be generated quite simply with a laser beam and a photo element and a suitable electronic to convert the signal that comes off the photo element into a suitable trigger pulse. I have to check on the strobe light to see what is needed there.   Geometry:   You had mentioned that you currently look at one bar code at the front of the box (from a 45-degree angle). The bar code is approx. 1.5 inches wide. Obviously,  you need to take a picture that shows a larger field of view as the bar code could be in different places on different boxes. For now, I am assuming that you can find the label if it is in a, say, 4 feet by 3 feet area of the box. You would need a camera that  can image the 4x3 feet area with a resolution of at least 500 um (as postulated above).    4 feet is 1,219 mm, 3 feet is 914 mm. To resolve 500 um on this area, you would need a camera with a resolution of roughly 2,400 x 1,800. The same calculation applies  to the camera on the side of the box. If you wanted to get the same resolution with a single camera posted at an oblique angle to see both labels, you would probably need a higher resolution camera, something like 4,000 x 2000.   This would also require finding the right lens, which depends on the distance of the camera from the box.    Frame rate.    The boxes come along on a belt that runs at 3.6 m/sec. Depending on the length of the box and the spacing, that means you will need multiple images per second (for  example, if the boxes are 2 feet long (50cm) with a gap of 50 cm, you would need pictures every 1/3.6 second, or a frame rate of 3.6 frames per second. That’s not a very hard requirement, considering that even the 12 Mpixel (4000 x 3000) in the (relatively  slow) USB3 implementation can go up to 30 fps. This camera would be good enough for a situation where you would have a bar code every 12 cm on the belt.    So, which camera should you use?   I would suggest taking a look at our xiC cameras. They come with the right combination of resolution, exposure time and frame rate. In particular I am thinking of the MC050MG-SY for the front and side cameras, or the MC124MG-SY for the oblique cameras. I would recommend using monochrome  cameras as the color does not provide additional information, and the physics of color sensors reduces the sensitivity and resolution of the color cameras compared to monochrome cameras.   Using a Jetson with the USB3 cameras is very straightforward: You just need a carrier board with a USB3 port, plug in the camera, and you download our API and immediately acquire images. The trigger option requires a bit more electronics and cables, but we do  have the cables in stock, and it is very simple to set up the camera in triggered mode. I will have to investigate the strobe light.For more information about our Jetson implementations, check here:   TX2 carrier boards:  https://www.ximea.com/en/products/xilab-application-specific-custom-oem/embedded-vision-and-multi-camera-setup-xix/carrier-board-for-nvidia-jetson-and-cameras API information:   https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Linux_TX1_and_TX2_Support Jetson Image Processing:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Image_Processing TX2 vs Xavier:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_TX2_vs_AGX_Xavier Nano benchmarks:  https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/Jetson_Nano_Benchmarks     Loan cameras:   We do have some of these cameras available as loan cameras, but my colleague Kevin is managing the loan program. I will get him involved if you want to try the  camera to see if it works. The loan program is pretty straight forward. We have a loan agreement that we need signed, and we need some security (typically a credit card). Then we can ship the camera and there will be no charges on the card if it comes back  undamaged. Things get more complicated for loans outside the US, as you would be responsible to deal with customs and taxes in the destination country.   Further thought:   What sort of environment can we expect? Is the belt and machinery causing dust? In that case it might be better to put the Jetson (if you want to use one) plus  the camera and lens into a dust-proof enclosure, which in turn may make it easier to use not a standard USB3 or PCIe connection, but a ribbon cable connection (non-standard) with a custom interface board for the Jetson. We can also discuss that, if you want.  We can design such an interface board to your specifications.   I am attaching a brochure for the xiC cameras and am looking forward to hearing back from you.   Regards RE: XIMEA // Your Reference Number CASE-0036517     Sorry.
